hey everyone I just want to quickly let
you know that the video release schedule
will slow down for a little bit because
as you can see I'm moving and it's a bit
more than I anticipated
um my whole studio is already
disassembled and my editing PC as well I
don't have internet yet at the new place
so I cannot work on new videos I cannot
edit videos I cannot record new videos
so everything will you know be a bit
delayed sorry about that
