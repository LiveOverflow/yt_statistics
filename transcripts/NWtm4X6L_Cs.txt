How can you protect yourself from 
phishing? I work as a security consultant,
I’m a “professional hacker”, and I wanted 
to tell you what you have to look out for.
But before you listen to what I have to say, 
why don’t you share in the comments what you
do to not get phished, and then after the 
video you can check if you do it like me.
Phishing describes an “attack” where somebody 
tries to trick you, to enter your login
credentials on a fake website. The website 
might look and feel like the real website,
but the actual domain is different. When entering 
the password here you basically give it to the
attacker voluntarily. I mean, not voluntarily, 
the attacker tricked you. But this is actually
extremely SIMPLE to do. Every beginner web 
developer can do that within the first week
of learning programming. It’s very simple, but 
extremely effective. Besides reusing the same
password on different websites, phishing is the 
main risk of getting your account hacked. So how
can we make sure to not fall for those tricks?
How can we know if we are on a trustworthy site
or a fake phishing site?
I actually already mentioned the solution.
Look at this. What’s the difference between 
the real website and the fake website? It’s
the domain. This is the most important security 
indicator you have. In fact it’s the only security
indicator you have, to determine if this is the 
real website, or if it is the phishing website.
So you have to look at the URL to find the 
domain. But understanding a URL is not simple.
It’s actually pretty hard. EVEN for computers it’s 
hard and we expect at least them to understand it.
If you are curious I made a video once about 
“HOW FRCKN' HARD IS IT TO UNDERSTAND A URL?”,
but it’s a very technical video. So no need to 
watch it. But luckily as a user we don’t have
to go this deep into it. Even though this URL is 
extremely long, the browser helps us to identify
the part that actually matters to us. It’s the 
domain name here. You see that the browser is
highlighting the important part with a lighter 
color, and shows the less important part in grey.
As you can tell, this is the login page from 
Google and I’m using the Google Chrome browser
on macOs. But you might be using a different 
operating system and browser. So let’s look at
this page and URL bar in different environments. 
Here for example is the Edge Browser on Windows,
and an older version of Edge. As you 
can see, Edge does it similar to Chrome,
highlighting the important domain part. But 
checkout firefox. They also highlight the domain,
but only the main top domain. It does not 
include the subdomain when highlighting.
But that is fine, the subdomain, so the part 
before this dot, is controlled by the company
who controls the top part. The top part 
is google.com, so clearly that is safe.
Maybe firefox is helping us a bit more in this 
case, because to verify that you are really
logging into google.com, and not a phishing site 
like go0gle.com with a zero. So that kinda tells
you, to generally compare from the right. 
This is the main and most important part.
So now that you know that the domain is 
important for you to check if you are on
the correct website, let’s look at a browser on 
an iPhone. Because here is something interesting.
Here is Chrome and Safari. Look at this! They are 
completely hiding the full URL, and only show you
the important domain. Here you can clearly 
see, without getting distracted or tricket,
that this is indeed google.com. So it’s safe. And 
actually, this is what safari also does on macOS.
It also hides the URL path. I know, many technical 
people, including me, like to see the whole URL,
for hacking it’s important, but to be fair, for 
regular users who might be super confused by the
long complex URL, only focusing on the part that 
matters for security, the domain, is pretty good.
Actually recently Google was running an 
experiment on Chrome to also hide the URL path,
like safari, because they wanted to see if it 
helps with security for the general public.
But after a while they concluded that it didn’t 
improve important security metrics. So apparently
it didn’t really help to prevent more phishing. 
And I can see why. I think people who understand
they have to look at the domain name, will 
be fine with the highlighted version. And
for those who do not understand this, they won’t 
magically learn this from just seeing the domain.
So now I think you understand 
where you have to look,
and which part of the URL is important. Thanks 
to the browser highlighting parts of the URL,
you know what the domain is. So how do you 
now use this knowledge to prevent phishing.
It’s kinda simple, but you need to be vigilant. 
Basically you have to do the following. Before you
type in your password, practice to always look at 
the domain. It doesn’t matter how you got there,
maybe you clicked on a link a friend sent 
you, maybe you clicked on a link on reddir,
or you clicked on a link in a phishing spam 
email. But before you enter your credentials,
you need to look at the domain. And now you need 
to ask yourself, is this the correct domain?
Let’s do an example. So here is a login 
to the popular game distributor “steam”.
And it looks very legit. This looks like the 
steam page! And if you just glance at the URL,
maybe not really looking at it, it looks fine. 
Steamcommunity, that is the correct domain.
But we just learned that we need to carefully 
look at the URL and upon closer inspection,
we see something phishy going on. It’s actually 
not steaM, it’s steaRN. The small r and n looks
like an m at a glance! That is very tricky. Also 
the letters are switched here. The community
is misspelled. So this of course is already 
suspicious and reason enough to immediately
leave this site and not enter your password. 
But the best check is to compare it to the
real trustworthy site. How do you do that? 
Maybe you have the correct site bookmarked,
or you remember the URL, OR you can simply google 
for steam. And then you just need to go to the
login page. And when we find the same login page 
on the now clearly trustworthy site, and compare
the URL, you can now see that it differs. Simply 
switching back and forth between the pages you
can CLEARLY see that the domain is different. 
So now we know 100%, this is a phishing page.
And that’s it! This is basically what you have 
to do. You simply look at the domain before
you enter your password, and then you just 
need a way to quickly find the site you know
is the safe site, or you remember the 
domain exactly, and then compare it.
Unfortunately this seems a bit annoying to 
do. And you probably have a hard time making
sure your parents learn to do this. So an 
easier way is to actually let the browser
remember the passwords for a site. And you do 
not ever type in your own passwords. Because
now the browser checks the domain for you. The 
browser will only offer to autofill your password
if the domain matches. So this is 
an easy way to never get phished.
That’s it. That’s the only way you can figure 
out if the site you want to enter your password,
is the site you expected. The safe real 
site. Now I could end this video, but for
those people with a more technical interest, 
I’d like to talk about a few other things.
Checkout this super advanced steam phishing 
page. It looks very professional and trustworthy,
but it asks us to login to steam in a new 
window. So let’s apply what we just learned.
We know from earlier that the real steam login 
page is steamcommunity.com, we can check the URL,
and It looks correct! So is this safe? No, 
this is just a very clever phishing page.
This website is FAKING another window. It’s 
very obvious here, because this is a typical
windows window, and I’m on a mac. But this could 
be really confusing to a lot of users. You really
have to understand and know, that this is your 
real browser window, this is the real URL bar.
And all of this here can be fake. You can test it 
when you try to move the window around. It moves!
But only within the page. For example it cannot be 
moved over the actual browser window. So this is
the actual URL of the site, which is obviously not 
the expected steamcommunity.com. So it is fake!
That was pretty crazy, right?
Next, let’s tackle a technical question some of 
you probably have. “Your defense technique depends
on going to the phishing site and comparing 
the domain in the URL bar of the browser. So
that means, you already clicked and visited the 
malicious site? Doesn’t that mean it’s too late?”
Well… yes and no... a lot of anti-phishing 
and security awareness training teaches that
clicking on links is already bad. They try to make 
malicious URLs sound very scary. And instead of
clicking on them, you should do other checks. For 
example check if the URL starts with https://. Or
look at the domain of the link before clicking. 
Or in cases where the link is not shown, hover
over the link and check the URL there. But check 
the URL how? Now it’s very difficult to know which
part is the domain, it’s not nicely highlighted, 
and also links can be faked. For example in HTML
emails the displayed link can be different from 
the one that is actually there. Or a seemingly
trustworthy URL is redirecting you to the phishing 
site once you click. And when you do this hovering
test, you might be wrong anyway, for example 
microsoft often sends mails with these weird
domains, they look cryptic and phishy, and in fact 
some people online believe it’s phishing, but it’s
just a link tracker. It is microsoft.com so it’s 
trustworthy and it redirects to a safe site.
But this advice is also not completly useless. 
You can apply all of that. But it only helps
you to identify a phishing link early. IT DOES 
NOT TELL YOU if it’s really trustworthy. There
are lots of indicators it’s phishing, and 
it’s great if you can reject a link early
for being clearly phishing. But there is only ONE 
test to be sure it's not phishing. To be sure it’s
a safe site. And that is to check the URL bar 
in the browser, before typing in your password.
Actually, there is one more small test you can do. 
If you click on a link and it asks you to login,
you can open another browser tab, go to the real 
website and make sure you are logged in. So if you
are not logged in, log in now to the site you know 
is safe. And once you are clearly logged in, now
click on the original link again, and if it still 
asks you for username and password, it could be a
phishing attempt and you should check the domain. 
Sometimes websites ask for a password again for
additional security, so check the domain to make 
the final decision. But if it takes you now to
some other content and doesn’t ask you to login 
again, you know 100% the link was not phishing.
“But… but… clicking on malicious links is 
dangerous. Attackers could already hack you”
Well… yes? But mostly no. Stop the fear mongering 
about malicious websites please. Let me explain
why. First of all it is very important that 
you use an up-to-date browser. In particular
that would be Firefox, Chrome or Chromium, 
Safari or Edge. They should also automatically
update themselves, so you should not have to 
worry about that. So why is this important?
Browsers are a very very complex 
piece of software. It seems simple,
just display a website here. But that is very 
complex. And complex software will always have
programming mistakes, which an attacker might be 
able to exploit to install malware on your device.
So to understand why people say that clicking on 
links is bad, we have to go back in time in the
late 2000s to early 2010s, browser exploit 
kits were very very widespread. It was not
uncommon that you visit a malicious website, and 
it would exploit a vulnerability in your browser,
or an extension like ActiveX, Java applets or 
Flash, to install malware on your computer.
This was also called drive-by download. 
And once malware is on your computer,
they could steal all your passwords. This was 
even a “business model”, as a blackhat criminal
hacker you could rent or buy a collection of these 
vulnerabilities in so-called exploit kits. And it
was a business model because it was affordable. A 
blackhat criminal could pay a few hundred dollars
per month to get access to an exploit kit that 
contained dozens of vulnerabilities. And back
then, browsers were not automatically updated, new 
vulnerabilities constantly were found and so this
was a real threat. Now over the years, browsers 
got a lot more secure. Though vulnerabilities are
still constantly found,. But let me try to explain 
why it’s different today. Here is for example the
website of Zerodium in July 2021. They are an 
exploit broker, they buy vulnerabilities from
security researchers and sell them to for example 
government agencies. And this is the price list of
what they pay for an exploit. For a remote code 
execution including a local privilege escalation
in Safari, Edge or Firefox, they pay up to 
100.000$. And for Chrome they even pay up to
500.000$. Now that Edge is also based on Chrome, 
I suspect this kinda changes now as well. So this
means two things. First I can guarantee you that 
there exists an exploit for your browser right
now. A very powerful attacker could theoretically 
take over your device when you visit a malicious
website. But then, how does it make sense when 
I say you shouldn’t be scared of clicking links?
Well, the economics are different now. These 
exploits are very expensive. It’s not affordable
anymore by your random blackhat hacker who tries 
to spread malware to thousands of people. So yes,
there are still people being targeted by it, but 
you are probably not one of them. Let’s be fair,
you are too unimportant, so it’s a threat you 
probably shouldn’t worry about. And keeping the
browser up to date is the most important defense 
you can do, because it means older, cheaper
exploits are not usable against you anymore. 
That’s probably the best defense you have.
But this also means if your company requires you 
to use an older Browser like Internet Explorer
because you have to access some internal intranet 
application, do not use this browser to visit
anything else. For any other website please use 
an up-to-date Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge.
Now before I end this video, I briefly 
wanted to mention two-factor-authentication.
Oftentimes 2fa is hailed as the solution against 
phishing. But this is not really the case. It is
true, two-factor-authentication is effective 
against the most basic form of phishing. So
when you enter your password into a 
phishing site, the password is stored,
and an attacker can use the password later to 
login and take over your account. But a really
advanced phishing page, can still phish you.
For example the advanced steam phishing site
from earlier, when you have an account 
with two factor authentication enabled,
the site notices that, and simply also asks 
you for the code. So how cann this work?
Well, it’s not different than 
when a friend sits at the PC,
and you tell him your username, password and 
authentication code. And they type it in for you.
that’s what the phishing website does too.
When you enter your credentials, in the background
the site already tries to login to steam, sees 
that a code is required, asks you for the code,
and then can supply it. Now the phishing site 
is logged into your steam account and can do
anything. This is definitely more technically 
advanced, and requires a lot more coding skills
than a basic phishing site. But it’s also 
not magic. So two factor authentication
definitely can help against all the basic 
phishing stuff, but it’s not bullet proof.
So to summarize.
It’s good to look at various indications
to recognize a phishing link early, hovering over 
links, looking at the email it’s coming from,
looking at obvious spelling mistakes, 
and so forth. BUT once you clicked,
always keep in mind to look at the browser 
URL bar and make sure the domain, the part
the brower highlights for you, matches the safe 
login site you know. And then you should be safe.
