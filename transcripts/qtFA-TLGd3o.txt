A while ago I made a video explaining my video
making process.
And since then I made several changes and
improved it.
So I wanted to give you an update on that,
so it’s easier for you to start making CTF
video writeups.
I’m not saying that’s how you should do
it, but I will tell you about my experience
and why I do it this way.
so if you consider making videos, I think
I can give you some valuable information here.
And then you can come up with your own process.
So the process changes slightly depending
on the topic, but in this case here I will
cover a CTF video write-up.
The CTF challenge is from the google ctf 2017,
it was a hard challenge called a7 - gee cue
elle.
First of all I moved away from sony vegas
to adobe premiere, because I was hoping it
had better integration with photoshop to draw
my overlays to improve my videos.
Well that didn’t turn out to be true, but
I still think the move was worth it.
doing animations, like moving graphics and
rotating them and so forth, directly in Premiere
is much easier than in vegas, but drawing
and making the graphics for it is still not
integrated into each other well.
And another downsite is that Adobe products
cost quite a bit per month, but I really enjoy
making those videos so it’s worth investing
into my hobby.
Okay.
So I start with a template that has the intro
animation as well as outro already in there
and then I add the recordings I made with
OBS during the CTF.
Then I go over each video file and label it
with the challenge it was about.
So the first problem is, that CTF challenges
take time and are often a mess.
I don’t record 12h of my screen and then
try to extract 10min of content from it, and
even more important is, that the recording
is not really optimised for a video writeup.
I use a big resolution, sometimes multiple
screens and multiple devices, it just is not
great footage.
I will get into that a little bit later when
we come to editing.
So usually I always record a little bit during
the CTF when I have a feeling I made substantial
progress.
And this way I also don’t forget my steps.
Then I open up a google doc for the script
and start going through the footage and start
writing.
“A7 - gee cue elle was a hard misc challenge.”
and so forth.
While writing I already try to imagine how
I would show that with a video.
And I think about what errors I like to include
and what I will leave out, what I would like
to focus more on and what is unimportant.
Trying to come up with a nice story.
So some videos become more basic, others become
more advanced.
Usually I am for about 3 pages in google docs
with arial font 11.
That will create a 9-12minute video.
So I continue writing the script.
Check and verifying some stuff, try to find
the parts in the recording and so forth.
Now I’m already a page in and I basically
just started with the challenge, so I start
to wonder if I can’t cover it in 3 pages.
In this case there is quite a bit of code
we have to read and understand and that’s
always a bit tricky for a video.
When you do the challenge yourself you spend
a lot of time reviewing the cdode and maybe
comment everything, maybe you extract pieces
and run them on their own, but for a video
you have to keep it short and kinda point
out only important parts.
But that could mean the audience doesn’t
understand the application at all.
so that’s just something to keep in mind
and is difficult to balance.
After a while the first draft is done.
Way over my 3 pages limit.
Now I use a timer and read the script out
loud again, fix some minor grammar and flow
issues and check the length.
Looks like this video is going to be a bit
longer.
Now I have to decide, make two parts and flesh
these out more, or make one longer part.
This one is hard because it’s right there
at the border.
So I decide to go with one video for now.
I could always split it later.
When i feel like the script is done, I go
back to premiere and record my voice over.
And FYI, up until here took me about 3 hours.
Now I start to assemble the video and edit
it.
Like I mentioned earlier, the video recordings
from during the CTF are often shitty.
Tabbing around, having personal information
in notifications visible, small fonts, crowded
terminals etc.
This means I usually reenact most stuff again.
So for example here I want to record how I
searched for OWASP A7 again.
Some things to consider when recording footage.
Try to match the aspect ratio of the video
with your windows.
A small trick to do that is to use some kind
of image or the video preview to make a clean
browser window in a perfect 16:9 aspect ratio
Try to have the font big enough, that it could
be read without fullscreen or high quality.
There are a lot of mobile phone users out
there.
Typing is always slow.
Speed those parts up.
And have very determined mouse movements.
Try to not include the spelling mistakes and
corrections.
Try to focus as much on what you want them
to see, and minimize unecessary information
If you are typing in a terminal, try to leave
a border at the bottom or always clear the
terminal so you write at the top, because
when you pause in youtube the bar stays on
and covers up what you typed.
Super annoying.
ANd like with any write-up, you have to clean
up your code.
That’s another big reason why using the
footage from during the CTF is so bad.
It’s always messy.
At some point I’m done arranging and editing
the video in Premiere.
Because I had to reenact and rerecord so many
things and look through footage it probably
took me around 4 hours.
But I’m not fully done yet.
First I have to export the video in Premiere
and then open it in Photoshop.
Yep you heard me right.
I open the video in photoshop, because photoshop
can do video editing.
And this is pretty cool to draw my overlays.
So basically I go now through the video and
create layers on which I can draw with my
graphics tablet.
And that’s super easy and chill and goes
pretty fast.
That’s basically my secret of doing my overlays.
Unfortunately I can’t animate stuff here.
So I can’t animate moving graphics or so.
If I plan to do that, then I usually create
the graphics first and import them to premiere.
But that’s pretty tedious.
I really would like a better process here,
because animations would be really cool.
Then I render the video in photoshop, which
is buggy, because sometimes the audio in the
beginning cuts out, which apparently happens
when the disk can’t read the video source
file fast enough and I have the footage on
a huge hard drive, not an SSD.
So what you can do is quickly play the video
with vlc, because then it seems to be in memory
or so and I never have a problem.
Anyway.
This part took me about an hour or so.
So it’s pretty fast
Next step is uploading…
so going To youtube…..
Oh…
Gynvael is streaming right now.
Better go watch this instead.
After procrastinating, but also learnign awesome
new stuff, I finally do the upload and create
a thumbnail for it.
Then some other small stuff has to be done,
like adding the transcript for the subtitles
and adding the endcard.
If you pay attention to the upload date and
look when I publicly released it, you can
see that quite some time passed.
I actually always have videos in the pipeline.
When I made this video I had 6 unreleased
videos which means I have a buffer for over
a month.
And that’s important to me, because I always
have bursts of motivation and I go crazy a
few days making videos and then I need a break
again.
And for example in the recent weeks I had
ton of work and was travelling and couldn’t
make any videos.
So now I have only 2 videos left.
That’s also the reason why I don’t really
make up-to-date news videos often.
Basically there was only the nintendo switch
and dirtycow video I made.
It feels really good to release a video consistanly
every week but I don’t want to have anxiety
and the pressure to create another video.
I can go comfortably on vacation or just play
a game without feeling guilty.
Overall you can see it takes me about one
full day to create a video, without the time
it took me to solve challenge or research
a topic.
if I would care less in making the footage
look good or not write a script and be good
at just talking and improvising, I could be
a lot faster.
But that’s how I like to do it right now
and, I’m curious how I change my process
over the next year.
My videos have changed a lot from when I started.
Hope it helps, I wanna see more CTF video
write-ups.
