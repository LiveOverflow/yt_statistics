The last Minecraft hacked 
episode was not well received,
because apparently I talked about three 
different hacks that already existed.
Pretty lame. Well… let’s talk about it. In 
german we would say: “Ich mach mal ne Ansage”
So here is part 1. About the reach hack.

I teased the existence of a reach hack without 
revealing how it works. Because I thought it’s
somethin new. Well.. Apparently the reach hack is 
already known and called TP Aura or Infinite aura.
And several people in the comments were exactly 
right about how it works. The reach is basically
a neat trick and it simply involves teleporting 
to the target, hitting it and teleporting back.
This is what took me 14h hours to figure out 
myself. I know I’m an idiot that it took me
this long. Anyway. Let me walk you through 
what happens when I hit the sheep here.
When I click my button to attack this 
sheep, I first send a PlayerMove packet,
which contains the coordinates I want to be 
at. And I place myself close to the sheep. But
you have to be careful. This distance from my old 
position to the new one, is the maximum “teleport
distance” the server allows. Anything further and 
the PlayerMove packet would be rejected and the
server sends back a Synchronize Player Position 
packet to basically reset the position back.
Alright, we teleport forward. We can increase 
the reach to hit the sheep even further,
if we calculate how far we can be away 
from the sheep to still hit it. And
then factor that in. So after I send 
the position update to this position,
I can send a Player Interact Entity Packet, which 
says I want to attack this entity, this sheep. And
right after the attack I send another PlayerMove 
packet to put myself back to where I came from.
And because I send these packets directly 
using a ClientConnection invoker mixin to
access the sendImmediately packet 
function, you don’t see anything.
I send the packets in the background, so in 
the game it just looks normal. Pretty neat.
ALSO other players don’t see 
you teleporting either. That’s
because of the tick rate of the server.
While we might send a lot of movement
packets per tick, the server only updates 
the position to the other players once per
tick or so. So while we send, teleport 
forward, attack and teleport back,
all the players will see is, the player 
is here, and oh this sheep got attacked.
Yeah… it’s really that simple. But it took 
me a while to figure it out. And even worse,
I was only able to attack a sheep from this 
distance. actually It took an embarrassingly
additional amount of time, to figure out 
how to attack mobs from even further away.
The solutions is so obvious that I really don’t 
know why it took me this long. Take a guess. What
do need to do to attack from even further away?
Simply send more movement packets in between.
I think it took me so long because I completely 
overcomplicated the issue. I was looking for
logic bugs and other issues, while I just 
had to use the packets and movement as it is.
Anyway.
To get larger reach
distance you can send playermove, playermove, 
playermove , always with the max amount of
distance that the server allows. You need to 
research in the code how far that is again,
I think it’s like something between 8-10 
blocks per movement packet or so. Anyway.
Then we hit the mob. And teleport backwards 
with playermove, playermove and playermove.
Done. You can basically do this in ONE 
TICK. so again, other players probably
don’t see you teleporting at all. And it just 
looks like you hit somebody from far away.
Now implementation of this is a bit tricky. The 
code can get pretty ugly. Your game constantly
sends these playermove packets, and when you 
send your teleports for the reach attack,
and in the middle comes a normal player move 
packet, the teleport distances are messed
up and the server resets your position. Also 
anti-fly kicks are something you need to think
about. When you execute reach upwards, you might 
miss your anti-fly bypass packet and get kicked.
So it takes a lot of programming effort 
and thinking of all the different cases
in order to implement something robust. My 
implementation is not that good and fails a
lot. But here is in general the code. So when 
I have a target Entity that I want to attack,
I call teleportFromTo, which calculates 
how many packets we need to get there,
and then sends the position update 
packets. After that we do the attack,
followed by another teleportFromTo 
backwards to the original player position.
Anyway… all of that took me a lot of time. 
I’m really not the smartest hacker. I can be
very slow when it comes to this stuff. 
BUT I still figured it out myself. And
that is what really matters to me. So I’m 
actually glad I didn’t know that this is
already a technique implemented by hacked 
clients. And that is what is fun to me,
and that’s how I learn new stuff. 
I want to figure it out myself.
So let me show you the sheep challenge I 
built.Here for example is 7h3 with a Club
Mate in their hand. And I‘m very disappointed that 
they do not use my amazing resource pack. Anyway…
They sacrifice the mate to the enchantment table, 
a sheep appears far away, hits it with reach. And
Completed it.
Cool.
But can we talk about something else for a 
moment. WHY THE F’ IS THIS CALLED TP AURA or
INFINITE AURA? AND NOT REACH HACK, REMOTE ATTACK 
OR TELEPORT ATTACK? TP AURA? INFINITE AURA?
Who comes up with dumb names like that? What’s 
wrong with all you hacked client script kiddies?
Anyway… speaking of reach. Maybe what you don’t 
know is. There is an even more advanced teleport
reach hack out there. Because the basic method 
we just talked about, where we teleport in steps
to the target, breaks when there is an obstacle 
in the way. When our line of sight for example
contains a tree, and we try to teleport 
into that tree, we get our position reset.
So how is it possible that some player on 
the server can sit inside a house far away,
and attack players in the spawn 
hole? Surrounded by lots of blocks?
Well… I can tell you this much, 
it is a variation of the tp based
reach. But… it uses a few more tricks.
So for this I created another challenge.
Come with me. I show you… just behind the trees 
here. There it’s hidden. This is - The vault.
This is a BIG cube of bedrock and it contains a 
small room storing something valuable. There is
no way to enter it. Any teleport attempts into 
it will fail. Here I try to change my teleport
distance attempting to teleport inside. It doesn’t 
work. You cannot send a position update this far
into the cube. It’s too far. Or is it?
Well.. if it’s impossible, how can it
be that some players can press the button on the 
outside, and then moments later press the button
on the inside? Stealing my valuable secrets?
Well… actually… I don’t know myself. I have
no clue. Really. I stared at the code for 
many hours and tried to figure it out. And
I don’t know. I have no clue.
But at the vault I told them:
“If you try to steal my secrets, I will steal and 
expose yours. I'm serious, you have been warned!”
So what’s the conclusion.
Yes, the reach hack was already known.
You were right. But that doesn’t matter! Who of 
you actually looked into the code and implemented
it yourself? This is exactly like downloading a 
minecraft build, instead of designing something
yourself. So I ask you. Do you want to do 
minecraft hacking? Or just minecraft cheating?
Anyway. Let’s come to the community showcase. 
Today we have enderkill98. Fun fact,
He is the player with the most mined 
cobblestone on the server by far,
because he was very busy clearing lava 
casts from some kiddies. So Take it away.
hello my name is Linus I'm from Germany my ingame 
name is Enderkill98 and this is a Showcase of my
very first mods I made to join the server which 
I miss out as you can see here I have a fabric
installation with mostly vanilla tweaks this is my 
modelist notable mods that are not tweaks but more
like hacks are X-ray and entity outliners as I did 
do not myself otherwise all hacks are self-made my
hack interface is mostly just like text in the top 
left just rendered into the in-game HUD that is my
layout it's rendered into this class like 
using the in-game hut into the random
method and then just I think it accesses like 
a drawstring with Shadow that's the basic thing
otherwise those are the hacks I have made for now 
a clip like detects uh barricade tries to tell
what behind it mostly useful for v-clip only oh 
yeah fly free cam stuff free cam for example if I
first exit fly and then just activate it I can 
go out below it's basically like a spectator
mode but I can also like place a block if I 
select it beforehand I can go here place it
so that works for the next mod the basic one is 
fly I did the second iteration it's kinda nice to
use default speed is 1x I can hold my keyboard 
and press left to right Mouse button to change
the speed or I can press print and get like six 
times the speed useful for traveling perfect
and first respawn for example yeah that this 
basic fly no fire for example is pretty simple
it like cancels my velocity you can see like my 
foil being a bit janky but it's pretty reliable
if I am going first water into the ground 
it usually functions sometimes it fails but
pretty early for the next more Autoplan is pretty 
simple if I'm going to just destroy a bunch and
if if I'm going to get a bit more seats and 
now press like that key for it it will just
do it automatically in a certain range then the 
next mod I have the shortcuts the basic interfaces
here the text and also I've added keybinds for 
it it's a simple API you can add for fabric and
those are basically all my keyboards I have also 
one thing I have like uh someone short of some
nice exploit like he could like reach infinity 
basically I had an idea for the concept mine
is not as good as this it's not the same but I 
have a pretty far reach I think like 150 blocks
and I can just enable it and if I'm now 
hitting him you can hear I am amplify The
Sounds it works if I'm now going to debuff 
still 108 still 126 so it's pretty far range
I also can focus on someone so if I now use the 
leg in the top left let's focused on the player
if I for example now look away it will still hit 
the person as you can hear my solution for the
fountain challenge the first attempt was a pretty 
slow one like it was it was basically this mode
like super slow going down and then that is how 
I became hacker however I improved it a bit it's
not super reliable but it's mostly working 
depending on the Ping I guess it's sometimes
not lagging as much or not or more and I can do 
that pretty quickly also I can speed it up a bit
it's a bit more risky but it seems to work right 
now and yeah that looks pretty rare of course
if I turn it off and move now I'm above again 
that should be my module case I will include a
few shots of me killing things if needed and yeah 
that should be it I guess [Music] foreign [Music]
