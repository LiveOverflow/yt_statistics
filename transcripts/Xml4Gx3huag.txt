Google offers a ton of services.
There is google search, youtube, gmail, drive,
but they also offer a cloud platform.
And one of the services there is BigQuery.
BigQuery is a fast, fully managed enterprise
data warehouse for large-scale data analytics.
BigQuery can scan Terabytes in Seconds and
Peta Bytes in minutes.
A lot of buzzwords but what is it good for?
So it basically is a big data platform and
service anybody can use.
This is something nobody can do on their personal
computer and BigQuery allows you to do stuff,
that generally would require some big machines.
So here is how it works.
You have a question you are looking to answer
and so you write an SQL query for a big dataset.
You let it run and get the result back.
It’s not much different from your phpmyadmin
or your small school exercises, the difference
is just, this can run on Terabytes of data.
And the other cool thing is, BigQuery comes
already with public datasets that you can
use.
There are huge databases with data on baseball
games, census data, crimes and so forth.
You can find some really cool examples to
play with out of curiosity, or even use it
for a research project.
I got really excited when I saw that BigQuery
had a public github dataset.
For example somebody ran a query to check
how many files use spaces or tabs for indentation.
So i thought about what I could do, and I
was thinking, people leak their passwords
and ssh private keys on github, maybe they
also fail with bitcoin wallets, their private
keys.
Maybe that’s my way into a luxurious life!
So I checked again how a bitcoin address looks
like and built a regular expression for it.
Basically they all start with a 5 followed
by a HJ or K and then followed by other base58
valid characters.
And to not match this in random text, I made
sure that before this match there is either
the start of a line or NOT a regular character.
So spaces or quotes or colons would be fine.
Same thing for after the key, just with line
ending.
Then I looked up some examples that people
have done, because I’m doing it for the
first time.
And so I just modified this here a bit.
You can also investigate how the datasets
look like you want to query.
The fields they have, some details like the
size, this is important for what the query
will cost, and you can also preview the data
to get an idea what you will get.
So here is what I came up with, we first query
all contents, so all file contents where this
regex matches, and return those matches together
with an id.
And then we join this resulting table with
the files database, which contains the repository
name, and the file name or actually file path.
The result will be a table with hopefully
bitcoin wallet keys and where they were from.
It takes a few seconds to run those 2TB of
data, but returns very quickly a result with
over 10.000 matches.
Isn’t this crazy, we just queried over 2TB
of data in a matter of seconds with a regex.
TWO TERABYTES.
Anyway.
I took the result, downloaded it as CSV, wrote
a simple script using a python module to get
the bitcoin address for the wallet private
key, if it was actually a valid private key,
and then we use the blockchain.info api to
see if there are any funds available.
Buuut.
As it turns out, they are mostly empty.
Some had some movements in the past, and there
was even one with around 5 $ cents on it,
but when you look where they are from, they
are well known public private keys, they are
like examples from projects and so forth.
So unfortunately, my luxuries life has to
wait.
And actually this cost me around 5$, because
while the first terabyte is free, each additional
terabytes costs 5$ and this dataset had 2
Terabytes.
Oh well.
