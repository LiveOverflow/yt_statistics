Is the IT security and hacking culture a meritocracy?
meritocracy is a system in which economic
goods or political power, (so success) is
given to people on the basis of talent, effort,
and achievement, rather than wealth or social
class.
We generally want to think that in our hacking
culture, only hard working, skilled and talented
individuals are successful.
They are the ones that get the most money
(so “economic goods”) and are most famous
and thus are very influential ( so “political
power”).
In this video I might express some controversial
views because I include my subjective feelings.
And I can say right away.
I don’t have a clear opinion and you will
see that I suffer a lot from cognitive dissonance.
This cognitive dissonance is the reason why
I try to put my thoughts into this video.
But this also means, my views and opinions
will change over time, so don’t think this
is written in stone.
I divided this video into three large chapters.
First I want to talk about feelings, my background.
Then facing reality and my observations in
the IT industry.
And at the end talk about social media.

Chapter 1: My Background
If you have seen my t-shirt story playlist,
you know a lot about my life and getting into
IT security.
The first few conferences I visited were very
influential to me.
Because I didn’t know much about hacking
yet and I saw these incredible researchers
talking about really cool work they have done.
While the environment was mostly dominated
by men, there were several people openly transgender,
gay, cross-dressing or even just having blue
hair.
While it obviously wasn’t a very diverse
crowd, for me coming from a sheltered small
german village I felt like, in this hacking
culture, gender, age, sex how you dress, nothing
matters.
What matters is your skill and the work you
have done.
This was amplified online because, as you
know, we all have nicknames and anonymous
avatars.
When reading phrack articles I have no clue
who wrote that or how that person looks like.
It could be a good looking chad, a 50 year
old women or a polarbear.
It doesn’t matter.
When you send in your talk to a conference,
nobody knows how you look.
The talk is chosen based on the topic and
I will only see how you look once you walk
on the stage.
During this time I was also playing CTF.
And there it was double anonymous.
Not only every player used nicknames, but
they were also part of teams.
So I see these highscores and these team names,
but I have no clue who is behind it.
I only see that the PPP team was the best
in the world that year.
And when I looked at the trainings offered
at conferences.
They were super expensive, I could never afford
that, but I saw that many amazing researchers
who have shared awesome work, are the trainers.
They are at the top of their field, and they
are educating others.
And these very first impressions were so impactful,
that I carry these feelings around 10 years
later.
When I started liveoverflow making educational
videos 5-6 years ago.
I was very scared about the public perception.
I was not an expert.
I have not proven myself.
I have not shared any good research at a conference.
I am not known for my skills.
And yet, here I am trying to make educational
videos.
I felt like I was not allowed to do so and
if anybody would find out that me, fabian,
who tries to work as an it security consultant,
is such a noob, that would be bad.
That’s why I started this channel, without
face, anonymously.
The reason for why I was scared was, because
I felt this way about others.
I harshly judge everybody who has not done
what is necessary to prove their skill, yet
present themselves as experts or become very
popular.
I judge everybody.
So I also judge myself.
And over the years when I learned more and
more, and I eventually presented my own work
at a conference, I did well in hacking competitions,
and I received good feedback from researchers
I look up to.
I became more comfortable.
Now I felt like I was allowed to have this
YouTube channel.
Now I can be proud and say confidently that
I make good stuff here.
That being said, am I good enough to warrant
over 600.000 subscribers, 70.000 twitter followers,
and the fame that comes with that?
No…
I think I haven’t earned enough merit to
put this success into a balance.
A few years ago it even took me a long time
to eventually accept that I could ask for
Patreon or YouTube Membership money.
For a long time I thought I was not good enough
to do that.
I like to talk myself down.
And that maybe sounds weird to many.
But when I see I could be better, I want to
be better.
I want to earn my success through merit.
Which results in me wanting to learn more,
I slowly increase my merit, which leads me
to more acceptance of any form of success.
Now I think I’m good enough to earn some
money with LiveOverflow.
But not too much money.
Just a bit.
But unfortunately, as I said, I am not only
judging myself.
I also judge others.
I see people who, to me, are no experts and
have not proven themselves enough, yet are
very successful economically, for example
through selling courses, or became very influential
in general.
That feeling is obviously jealousy.
I know I am jealous there is no way to hide
that.
I want to make this clear.
These are my honest feelings.
I know they are bad.
I cannot judge somebody else's merit.
I have no right to request them to prove their
skill.
And what I perceive to be the right amount
of skill for a certain level of success, everybody
else will have a different scale.
I must not arrogate the decision to myself,
whether somebody has enough merit or not.
I know these are subjective feelings, and
clearly not based on any objective assessment.
So eventually I need to be able to get past
that.
I want to be happy for other peoples’ success
and not only when I think they deserve it.
And with that let’s move to Chapter 2: Facing
Reality.
The reason why I do not like to have these
feelings, is because I have seen how the world
actually works.
After I finished school and started studying
in a dual study program, I started working
at a large IT corporation.
During the following years I had different
“internships” in that company.
One in particular just left me dumbfounded.
I joined a team, so there were multiple people,
whose only job was it to look up data in one
program, and copy it over into an excel sheet.
And then the “manager” of that team would
run an excel macro that analyzses the data
for like 1 hour, and then spits out some graphs
and statistics they then presented to some
higher ups.
At this moment I realized, that the world
is full of weird jobs, that are pretty well
paid “in IT”, and do not even require
any skill.
But even for the jobs that seem to require
skills, for example as a developer or pentester,
I very quickly noticed skill is not that important.
I am a white guy in Germany with a very german
sounding name.
I knew I would have never a problem to find
work, because I knew I can be “convincing”
in an interview.
Of course it’s not just being a white dude,
I brought skill and experience, but I have
seen many people being more skilled than me,
not getting jobs or opportunities.
And here I am, having an easy time everywhere
I go.
Some people call it “softskills” or just
“we want to see if you fit into the team”,
but unfortunately prejudices from sexism and
racism are the actual driving factor if you
“fit in”.
As a white german harmless looking guy this
has never been a challenge for me.
Many of you look at my channel and think “yeah,
this person has skill, of course they can
get a job”, but did I get a job because
of merit?
My job doing security audits I did not get
just from from having skills, in fact at the
time I was very much not experienced.
It was “networking”.
I knew a guy who knew a guy.
To be more precise, I knew stacksmashing,
and he recommended me to somebody else.
And everybody a bit longer in the IT industry
would tell you, that many job opportunities
come from “networking” and meeting people.
And that in the end is very much the opposite
of a meritocracy.
Because now all that matters are the connections
and relationships you have.
I think this is also the best moment to recommend
this awesome video by veritasium, “Is Success
Luck or Hard Work?”.
Everybody who strongly believes only hard
work makes you successful, watch that please.
Of course some level of skill is required,
but hacking skills are very difficult to measure.
Yet companies need to do that.
So the industry is starting to get a lot more
regulations and checklists.
With only a little bit of training you can
follow those checklists good enough to be
sufficient for the corporate world.
That’s how large parts of the industry works.
The creativity and deeply technical hacker
skills are oftentimes not needed.
So if you are purely interested in this industry
for the money, then it’s really not that
difficult.
You probably have to spend 50% of your tinme
on learning, which you can easily cover with
a few basic certificates, and the other 50%
of your time you spend socializing and building
“your personal brand” and you should be
fine.
I hate that.
I personally am in IT security, because I
love the technical details.
And there are of course really technical and
awesome jobs.
But that’s BY FAR not the majority.
I don’t like it, but that’s just reality.
But the struggle I have goes further.
On one side I agree, that work life balance
is important and it’s also ok to do work
just for the money.
Nobody should be forced to work as much as
current culture requires it.
Mental health, taking breaks and focusing
on family should be celebrated and normalized.
But at the same time I’m not living that.
I’m not employed, so it’s a bit different,
but I love to sit in the dark for 16 hours
just hacking away.
Fuck work-life-balance.
I don’t want to go outside.
And I cherish every nerd who spends their
time building cool stuff or doing awesome
research, instead of “wasting their time
socializing”.
A crazy nerd can learn in 1 year much more
than many “normal” people will learn over
5 years at some corporate job.
In the end it always comes down to how much
time a person actually invests.
And I want to celebrate and acknowledge people
that do that.
But also at the same time, I know that’s
toxic, and that’s why I struggle with those
thoughts.
Looking at this objectively I don’t want
to be advocating a toxic lifestyle, and your
life is obviously worth living even if you
don’t want to be a basement dwelling nerd.
But at the same time I think it’s awesome
when somebody dedicates huge amounts of time
to projects and learning.
Cognitive dissonance.
I don’t know what to do with my feelings.
And that leads us to chapter 3: Social Media.
In the beginning I already mentioned how I
feel about the size of my audience and that
I also judge other people's social media success.
Social Media is a place for marketing.
On social media, good marketing and entertainment
will always succeed over any kind of actual
cool work.
And some people can play the game very well.
I very often find myself thinking about how
I want to approach my social media.
I hate to be a personality.
I want my videos to be the focus, not me.
But if you have been a subscriber for years,
you might have observed my slow evolution.
It takes me literally years to become more
comfortable with this “personal brand”
aspect of social media.
But it started with the first time showing
my face, getting instagram, making an autobiographical
video series about my life and appearing on
more podcasts and interviews.
One some days I think “f’ this, I don’t
want to be “famous”, and on other days
I think, “when other people are allowed
to be famous on social media, then maybe I
should be a public person as well, to be an
opposing force, somebody who can focus more
on the technical stuff.”.
This might sound a bit arrogant.
But I hope with my videos I can keep growing
and supporting the technical side of our hacking
culture.
I want to show the world how nerds reverse
engineer frogger, how bug bounty hunters find
crazy vulnerabilities and I want to highlight
the amazing skilled hackers doing awesome
research.
So I think if I play the social media game
a bit more, I could redirect this gained attention
to stuff I want people to be more excited
about.
Conclusion:
I don’t want to talk anybody down, I don’t
want to discredit anybody's success, because
I probably cannot judge any merit accurately
anyway.
And at the same time please do not mistake
success as being a sign for skill and good
work either - It doesn’t work this way.
I will still judge myself a lot, I think that’s
important, but I want to judge others less.
At the same time I will try to be more a part
of social media and slowly, very slowly, start
doing things I initially was more uncomfortable
with.
I really don’t want to become a bitter old
man, and so if I think I can do things better
than others, I should probably just go for
it.
So based on my feelings I wish we lived in
a meritocracy.
I wish we were all anonymous nicknames and
we just judge each other's technical projects,
research and bugs and nothing else.
I wish me being a white dude would not give
me so many advantages.
Unfortunately reality is not like that.
And trying to hold on to the fantasy of “merit”,
will always turn into toxicity.
