I thought it would be cool to tell you about
a typical day as a pen-tester.
Especially if you consider it as a career
I think you might appreciate the insight of
how this kind of job really looks like.
So welcome to my desk, I work from home.
And this is also where I edit my videos.
Usually I start by opening my laptop, login,
get pen and paper to take notes and then start.
Sometimes I really have to focus and think
of my next steps.
But then I usually get into the flow.
