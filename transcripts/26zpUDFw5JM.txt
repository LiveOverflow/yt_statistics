Hello everybody, let’s talk in this loopback
video about the recent events.
First we will talk about the new logo and
intro, then about reaching 10.000 subscribers,
that’s why we are doing a small Q&A. And
a little bit of an outlook into what’s coming
next.
So that was the new intro. Some videos I have
edited before I created this, so don’t get
confused when you see the old one again.
But what do you think about the new intro
and logo? I know it’s not the green hacky
rabbit and console anymore, which I used to
appeal to these people who are drawn to these
misrepresentations of hackers and show them
the “correct” way, and also because I’m
a sucker for these hacker stereotypes. Hack
the planet!
But I think these new style of videos, with
the hand-drawn overlays, match this new intro
better. I think it’s more professional and
future proof.
Let me know what you think about it. Especially
constructive criticism.
The channel hit 10.000 subscribers recently,
which is amazing, because it’s such a niche
topic. But that shows to me, that there is
real demand for this kind of content. And
people appreciate it as valuable information.
Which makes me really proud.
So, now I’m going to answer questions I
got. I have to say, not many people sent me
questions which is a bit of a bummer, but
actually, I think this just shows that you
are more interested in technical content,
rather than the social youtuber interaction
personality thing, which is also why I don’t
show a face. I want this place to be about
learning new things about computers. Not me.
And now let me do a 180 on this opinion, and
answer some personal questions :D
Do you practice these things alot?
Most of what I do is practicing or learning
in a way. Especially playing CTFs you have
easy stuff you have done before and you get
faster, or new things to practice new tools
or techniques. One benefit of this channel
is, it forces me to not brush over topics
but make sure I understand them properly.
So creating these videos is very convenient
practice.
Do you make money with those skills?
I work as a freelance penetration tester,
or maybe betetr described as application security
analyst. I look at code and software, mostly
web, from customers and try to find vulnerabilities.
It’s a lot of fun, I’m very lucky I can
do this kind of work, and it allows me to
be very flexible. Especially because I still
have to finish my masters degree at university.
Do you have an or many Idol(s) (someone you
look up to for one or more reason(s))?
Everybody who is better than me in something.
So that’s a loooot of people :D
There are just so many who I admire for their
contribution to this field that I couldn’t
even start a list. There is no single idol
I follow, but more of an Ideal that I thrive
towards.
Would you consider yourself skillful, cognitively
gifted, or both?
I would say I’m not stupid. School was pretty
easy with a few exceptions like languages.
But I have seen a lot of peers understanding
certain things a lot faster a lot deeper than
me. And I benchmark myself against these people.
And you have to understand that I have spend
most of my life in front of these computers,
and I have days where I don’t leave the
apartment. And my friends are also not really
the types that constantly do stuff. So all
the skill I have, I have because I spend an
inconceivable amount of time doing this. And
I’m still no expert. I still fail the hard
complex challenges and I still haven’t created
an iOS or Browser exploit. I’m trying to
catch up but it’s hard. And so, knowing
how much time I have spent, and I have not
been able to compete with people at Pwn2own
or CTFs, shows me that I’m in no way gifted.
And there are many people who are much faster
than me.
What are some things you're currently trying
to "hack"?
Ehm, there are always work related projects
I can’t talk about. Or things that will
make it into a video, like the embedded hardware
CTF that is currently running.
When you get exhausted during a challenge,
what symptoms do you have and how do you mitigate
them?
I turn in a circle. I try the same things
over and over hoping it would magically work,
or that I have overseen something. That is
a time killer. I also start watching youtube
videos instead of working. The best thing
is to take a break, like a shower, or a quick
shopping trip.
do you (or did you at some point) play video
games?
Yeah I do play occasionally. Not much. For
a long time it used to be Guild Wars 2, did
some cool hacks with that, maybe it’s something
I can show off some time, but because it’s
still a very active game I feel a bit uncomfortable
disclosing it.
And currently I like to play Overwatch, because
I can play quick rounds when my brain needs
a break.
Have you found any zero day bugs yet? And
if so, how did you find it/them :D
I did find bugs you can consider 0day, but
they were nothing great. Nothing world breaking.
Not in any way comparable to cool remote memory
corruption bug in a popular sofawre. So I’m
still hunting for a cool one.
The ones I found were mostly web related and
found during work. So also something I can’t
talk about at this point. But believe me,
nothing exciting.
What are you using as your productive system?
I use a MacBook for most of my work. With
VMs as I need them. And also have a Windows
Desktop PC for editing or overwatch. As well
as multiple Laptops with Linux or whatever
on it. But mostly I work on mac.
So, now, what will come next. We are almost
done with exploit-exercises.com protostar.
That will be a great milestone for me. This
basically means I have now a whole series
that covers the basics of exploitation, and
which I believe is one of the better tutorials
on the topic on the internet.
I will push through this, with two videos
a week on friday and tuesday, which I have
done for a while now, but I can’t keep up
this pace for much longer. I spend too much
time on this, and while it’s fun, I can’t
neglect my real responsibilities too much.
So with christmas coming up, and finishing
protostar, I will start moving to a once a
week schedule. And hopefully the one or other
video in between.
But ignoring this huge disappointment, we
will slowly move into the modern age of exploitation
with ASLR, DEP and so forth.Also in february
the embedded hardware CTF will be over, so
you will get a bunch of low-level related
videos then.
Otherwise, I currently plan to make LiveOverflow
stickers, which if they turn out to be ok,
will bring
them to the 33c3 congress in december and
will distribute them on the well known tables
around the conference for people to grab.
Thank you all for your ongoing support, It
means a lot to me that people ask how to donate,
but the best thing you can give me, is to
comment and share the videos with more people
who might be interested in them.
Talk to you soon!
