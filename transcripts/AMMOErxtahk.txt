“Stop wasting your time playing games, and do 
something useful! Learn more about hacking,
learn a new programming language, practice 
with CTF challenges, write a blog post,
watch those talks you missed, read the papers 
you have bookmarked, or finally learn radare,
what is wrong with you? You are wasting your 
time!” - is what my brain tells me a lot.
I think everybody can relate to this. 
Especially in security and IT in general
you always play catch-up and the industry is 
constantly moving forward. In my talk from fsec,
where I make an argument for why I think CTFs 
are so great to learn hacking, I told you that I
always try to improve myself because I know there 
are people that are better than me, that are a
step ahead and I could do a much better job if I 
would know more. And that is motivating me a lot,
but it can also be very stressful at times. 
So let me tell you how I try to deal with it.
It’s terrible when you feel like 
you have to keep pushing and forcing
yourself to learn new things.
And usually that doesn’t work,
what ends up happening is that you 
feel terrible and depressed about this.
It’s weird, you are wondering where your 
motivation went - a couple of months
ago you remember sitting there solving 
rhme2 challenges day and night and now
the new board is laying here, not even soldered.
And instead, you play games like Guild Wars 2,
or Fortnite or these awwwful manipulative mobile 
clicker and idle games. And sure, they can be fun,
but you also end up in a miserable spiral thinking 
“why am i keep wasting my time? I wanna find cool
vulnerabilities, why am I not pursuing that?”.
So I wanted to tell you how I deal with this.
Because I’m not some kind of machine that 
can just solve CTF challenges every day
and work through tutorials, I also waste 
a lot of my time doing other stuff.
So… First of all... I try to allow myself 
to play games. Or do whatever seems fun and
relaxing. I know that sometimes I’m just not 
feeling like doing research or playing CTFs.
And that phase can be a day, or can be weeks, 
or even months. But the problem starts when I
get these negative thoughts that, what I do is a 
waste of time. Because then I get nothing from it.
I’m not learning anything new and more 
importantly, I can’t even relax and recharge,
which these games are supposed to help with. I 
need the break, but I’m not benefitting from that
break. So while It’s hard keeping these negative 
thoughts out, it’s something I very consciously
try to change by telling myself: “no, it’s 
ok, I’m just enjoying this game now. Shut up.”
Mental health is very important to me, especially 
since so many people in our community suffer from
depression or other issues that, I’m sure, are 
intensified from our very competitive, elitist
and stressful industry. So just allow yourself 
to relax and take that break that you need.
It’s absolutely ok! That is important to me.
But I still have these negative thoughts a lot.
And so while I try to actively manipulate 
my own brain into accepting playing games,
or whatever other activity, so I can actually 
enjoy it and relax, I have one other trick.
What I try to do is, if I “waste” my time with a 
game, and I can’t get out of that negative thought
spiral, why not do a project with that game? 
And so you can learn something along the way.
For example. For the past week I have 
been playing Clicker Heroes on my phone.
You have to click a lot and then buy heroes 
that will help you, you advance in the stages
and I felt sooo awful playing this game. It 
also has microtransactions and so forth, it’s
just your basic manipulative mobile game. However 
I noticed they have an export function, where you
can export and backup your game. And it also has 
an import function. Mhmh! That’s interesting. So
let’s export the current save and transfer it 
onto my laptop. It’s clearly base64 encoded, so
how does it look if you decode it? Mhmhm… that’s 
just binary data. And also the file utility
doesn’t recognize a filetype. So what to do next?
In the meantime I played for a little bit
more and so I can get a different save that I can 
export a. And now we can compare the two saves.
So first we can base64 decode and at the same 
time generate a hexdump of the binary data.
If we do this for both files, we can 
then easily look at the data in a diff,
I’m using vimdiff for this now.
So as you can see, the first 27(?)
bytes are constant. But the 
remaining bytes changed a lot.
This could indicate that it’s maybe 
encrypted, but even if it’s encrypted it is
likely that we could reverse engineer 
the method how its done from the app.
However I decided to run binwalk on one of the 
base64 decoded binary blobs and it turns out,
that binwalk recognized possibly zlib compressed 
data at position 24, or 0x18. So if we look again
at our hexdump, we can see that byte 24 is here. 
So I quickly looked up these values for zlib
and it turns out that 78 is the magic number for 
zlib and the next byte indicates the compression
method. 0x01 would be no compression, 0x9C is 
default compression and 0xDA is best compression.
So we can use the dd utility to cut out that 
part. So dd, read input from this binary file,
set the block size to 1 byte, 
and skip the first 24 blocks,
so the first 24 bytes. This will simply output all 
bytes after the 24th byte. And when written to a
file it is also now recognized by the file utility 
as zlib compressed data. Which we can now pipe
into something that decompresses it, for example 
openssl zlib. And the result is some json data.
goldMultiplier, totalHeroSoulsFromAscensions,
baseClickDamage, debug(?), totalGold, and 
so forth. You can see it’s all the settings.
So rubies is the currency that you have to 
pay for with real money. And there it is,
rubies. Let’s change it to something 
high. Oh and let’s also enable debug.
Now we have to do everything in reverse. We first 
pipe the modified json data into openssl zlib and
store it into a new binary file. But what about 
the 24 bytes data before the zlib compressed data?
Well I have no clue what it is used for, 
but it’s constant for both my savefiles, so
let’s just keep it. We can use dd again, with the 
original binary as input file, block size 1 byte,
and this time we just want the first 24 bytes, 
which we indicate with count. And now we combine
this output, with the zlib compressed data, and we 
pack it together in parentheses. And then pipe the
combined output into base64. Now that should 
be our new save game. Let’s try to import it.
Seems to have worked and when we check the ruby 
store we can see we have over 99 thousand rubies.
Oh and I noticed a console button has appeared 
in the menu which opens up this here. It’s a
tiny tiny console and I typed “help” into it 
and got a list of available commands. Awesome!
And so now I learned new stuff. I analysed and 
reverse engineered a custom save-game structure
and was able to modify it. I practiced using dd 
and improved my analytical skills - I hope next
time I will just recognize the zlib magic 
header right away. And so I turned feeling
terrible about playing this game into something 
positive. And I’m happy that I played this game.
AND, most importantly, I just ruined the game 
for me. Because now with all those rubies,
there is no fun anymore, no challenge 
left as you can just buy everything.
Let’s take a quick detour, because I 
just want to mention that I would have
not published this cheat or hack about 
this game because I don’t want to screw
over a small developer studio just for some 
10min internet fame. But when I did a quick
google search I already found a prominent save 
game editor for it out there. So the potential
financial damage is already done. However I 
would like point out, that even the developers
don’t like this manipulative microtransaction 
system. They have announced a Clicker Heroes 2
and in their blog about “Why Clicker Heroes 2 
is abandoning free-to-play” they write, that:
“we found that some number of players 
spent many thousands of dollars on rubies.
I can only hope that these people could afford 
it, and that they were doing it to support us,
and not to feed an addiction. But I 
strongly suspect that this is not the case.
[...]
We really don't like making money off players who
are in denial of their addiction. And that's what 
a large part of free-to-play gaming is all about.
[...]
That said,
we're not going to change how we monetize Clicker 
Heroes 1. It would destroy our studio if we did.“
And so they announced a clicker heroes 2, that is 
going to be a standalone game without the abusive
microtransaction. And look at this epic trailer.
[traile]
You can preorder it now for 30 dollars 
and it will hopefully be released in 2018.
And I appreciate their honesty and I really 
really hope that their game will be a success
and they can survive as a small game studio. And 
I understand the controversy about pre-ordering
games, but for me I preordered it because I can 
afford it and I want to support them. And their
Pre-orders qualify for full refunds for up to 
a year after we launch anyway, which is crazy.
Aaaanyway, just wanted to get 
that off my chest, because
ethics in research and reverse 
engineering is important too.
So now that I lost the motivation in the game,
I found again the motivation to do some 
more useful stuff, like making this video.
And there are many more examples like that. For 
example I play guild wars a lot and I was there
early on reverse engineering the trading-post API,
writing my own trading tools. Totally 
overengineered that, including a deep
research into Coherent UI, the framework they 
are using to implement the ingame web-browser,
but that’s a story for another time. And now they 
have a real open json API that you can access
with an API key. And there are many other games 
that offer APIs, for example league of legends.
Or if you don’t play games, you can checkout 
the reddit APIs. And that’s so awesome because
you can use it to practice some basic 
programming, how to interact with an API,
learn how to do HTTP requests and handle the 
response. I think that’s perfect to learn a new
language. And write some small tools, that just 
query your user’s information with. They don’t
have to be fancy, it’s just to learn something 
while also at the same time doing what you enjoy,
so browsing reddit or playing games doesn’t 
feel too bad. And then you can actually relax
with them, allow yourself to unwind, and you 
even benefit from it by learning something new.
