In early August 2018 I visit BlackHat and
Defcon in Las Vegas for the first time.
In this video I just want to casually talk
about my experience and in a second video
I want to talk more specifically about the
main reason for this trip, which was to participate
in the Defcon CTF.
So on August the 5th I flew from Germany to
Las Vegas via Zurich.
And at the zurich airport I saw this swiss
air advertisement and being german it kinda
made me feel weird :D
“I’m not leaving Switzerland - I’m taking
it with me” that sounds like a german propaganda
slogan from 1940.
Anyway.
The flight was pretty neat and this beautiful
ice and snow desert of greenland was a great
contrast to the sand desert that I was flying
to.
I was arriving when the sun was setting and
walked the strip completely exhausted to pick
up a SIM card.
And gosh it was still so hot outside!
I had two more days before Black Hat would
start so I used it to explore Las Vegas.
I took my first ever Lyft or Uber to the Las
Vegas sign and I told the driver my plan to
walk back up the strip.
He said I’m crazy to walk because of the
heat, but I just couldn't do it.
I guess Im still too german.
I just couldn’t call a taxi just for this
short trip to Mandalay Bay where I wanted
to pickup my Black Hat badge.
So I walked, it was hot a.f.
But it wasn’t that bad.
At the mandalay bay I also met a friend, picked
up my badge and met some new random friends
via twitter and we started walking up the
strip.
That was a lot of fun.
And the casions are just sooo weird.
The most crazy casino for me was the Luxor
pyramid.
I knew the pyramid from pictures but I didn’t
think it was that huge!
It was a legit pyramid.
And it was even more crazy inside.
Along all the sides of the pyramid are hotel
rooms.
What the f’.
That just…
I just…
I couldn’t comprehend.
What is going on…
So luxor is the egypt themed casino, then
we walked by Excalibur which is like a medieval
castle, reached the more european parts with
the small eiffel tower and the bellagio, which
is like a stereotypical french hotel and I
didn’t want to go to cesar’s palace yet
because I would go there for Defcon.
That was quite an interesting first day.
Always moving from air conditioning to air
conditioning.
What an insane place.
And to be honest, the next day, I had no clue
what to do.
I felt like I saw vegas now, there is nothing
else to do in this place.
So I took another rideshare to a wallmart
and bought some american stuff we can’t
easily get in germany.
Then the following day Black Hat started.
In general it made kind of an ok impression
on me, but I also didn’t have to pay for
a ticket.
I got a ticket from a friend who was a speaker
at Black Hat.
And Speakers can give two tickets to students.
And I’m still student.
So that was nice.
I watched some talks, for example Samuel’s
talk who is in the CTF team I will be playing
with in the Defcon CTF, talked to some people.
And spent some time walking around the vendor
area, which was just sooo foreign to me.
All these security endpoint cloud providers.
Really not my world.
but then I discovered the Arsenal where small
technical projects get an hour to present
their tools.
That was really awesome.
But later I learned that these awesome people
don’t even get flights and accommodation?
This was besides the talks the only cool thing
I saw at Black Hat.
Oh well… it is a business-relation conference
after all.
Overall I would go again if I get a ticket,
but it was also nothing special.
I wouldn’t travel this far and pay this
much money just for Black Hat.
But as many people will tell you, the conference
alone is not why you come to Vegas.
Actually there are many people coming to vegas
without going to the conferences and just
going to parties.
And while I’m generally not a party person,
in a group of other nerds, I can feel comfortable.
So thanks to Ed Overflow I got my very first
Las Vegas BlackHat party invite for the hackerone
party invite and I also went to Zero Fox party
at the top of the Delano, which was quite
impressive.
And actually there was the first person that
just recognized me as LiveOverflow and said
“hi”.
So that was interesting.
And after Zero Fox I also went to the Rapid
7 party.
Overall it was quite fun… doing that like
once.
Being here at Black Hat also meant I was able
to watch the Pwnie Awards live, which I was
really excited about.
But unfortunately, not to blame anybody in
particular, but drunk people on a stage is
kinda rough to watch.
Either Way I was excited for the winners.
I also finally met a colleague and friend
of mine for the first time in person, @filedescriptor.
He invited me over to the hackerone hacking
event, a multi day event where they invited
some bug bounty hunters, and did bug bounties
on different targets each day.
And that was also super cool to see.
I also met other people I only knew from twitter
before, and also met Zeta Two who I even collaborated
with before and has also started to make some
content and streams on YouTube.
Also with all the parties and other events
going on I really noticed again how having
a network really helps to have a good time.
I mostly had a great time this trip because
I got into parties and events, on short notice,
just because.
For example a friend at google provided me
a ZeroG invite on short notice.
And so I’m aware that I wouldn’t have
had the same experience 3 years ago.
Three years ago, before all this youtube stuff,
I would have been another awkard silent guy
walking around alone, not talking to anybody.
And just making some dumb youtube videos,
makes people start to care.
And that kinda makes me feel a bit weird,
but on the other hand it also kinda makes
me proud a bit, that I finally feel accepted
and respected in this security community through
something I have done.
I wish I was respected for cool research,
but that doesn’t work if I don’t do cool
research, but oh well.
I take what I can get.
And so in general I was only met with kindness
and people going out of their way to help
me have a good time.
And that was really really nice.
Anyway.
The night before Defcon our CTF team Sauercloud
met in the suite we booked to play from and
we did some first preparing.
I will make another video specifically about
the CTF which will be a bit more technical
but to summarise, it was so much fun.
I really loved it.
Even though I couldn’t really contribute
that much, it was still thrilling and exciting
to be part of.
And after the CTF there was a cool party in
the Suite from the Shellphish CTF team, because
they had like a two story suite.
I have never in my live stood in a crazy hotel
suite like that.
What kind of people book this.
I mean to host a whole CTF team that makes
sense, but what kind regular people do that.
So that was crazy.
Oh!
And before I forget it, I also finally met
Murmus CTF, he also has a YouTube channel
and he was playing right next to us for team
spaceballs.
So that was definetly a highlight for me.
At the last day I went out to dinner with
some from our CTF team and we walked through
this fake italian romantic street, with fake
stone plastic floor and fake sky and that
just gave me the finishing punch.
What the F’ las vegas.
This is just getting too much.
I was here only for about a week and I started
to not being able to stand this complete fakeness
and facade of it all.
It’s insane to think that this whole place
exists just because people throw money away
with gambling.
On my last day I ate some nice food I got
recommended on twitter and spent a large part
of the day with another random person from
twitter and had some nice conversations about
the arabic hacking community.
So that was cool because I never really was
exposed to it.
Then we drove to the airport when the sun
was setting again and finally flew back home
into sanity.
Before I finish this video I would like to
answer a question I got a few times.
If it is worth to spend so much money for
tickets and travel to attend conferences.
And that answer, is like for most questions,
not simple to answer.
So I would like to say that totally depends
on you.
My first conferences I went to were free conferences
so I only had to pay for Hotel and travel
- and that was already expensive as a regular
student.
But I did enjoy it, because it’s an interesting
atmosphere and if you watch the talks you
might get exposed to new fields.
But there is no secret content there.
Theoretically you can just watch talks online
or consume other forms of media.
So you don’t really pay for education, as
much as you pay for a change in environment.
Taking a break from the regular day-to-day
and switch context to a different world for
2 days and meet new people.
But meeting people is not so easy, I’m generally
a very introvert person, and didn’t have
any cool project to talk about introduce myself,
so back then I was mostly sitting around alone.
But for me that was super relaxing and I just
enjoyed the atmopshere.
It was really motivating me to learn more
and maybe someday be the person telling other
people something on the stage.
Nowadays it’s a bit different.
I like to spend money on trips to conferences
like the chaos communication congress.
I probably spend around 2500$ in flights,
hotel and other expenses (not including lost
work time as a freelancer) to go to Blackhat
and play Defcon CTF.
And that’s a crazy amount, right?
I would have not spent this money three years
ago.
Now it’s different.
I have a small network of people I know and
I’m excited to meet and I don’t have any
wrong expectations about a conference and
to me it’s taking a break from regular life.
So saving up a lot of money and then visit
one or two conferences in the hopes you will
learn everything and find a cool job, then
nope, that’s not a good idea.
A handfull of trips won’t really have that
big of an impact.
Though every conference, and other meetups
and events are potentially offering opportunities.
And the more you try, the higher the chance
is to benefit from it.
So what that means is, if you have money and
traveling to a conference is a small percentage
from your annual income (or your company pays
it), then go, why not.
But if it’s a large junk of money, then
be sure you really like it and go there without
high expectations.
And I’d suggest to try something small and
local first.
BlackHat, DefCon or CCC wont magically make
you a security expert or find your new higher-paying
job.
There can be opportunities there, but if you
have low expectations then you can’t get
disappointed.
And if you ask me personally, for me Defcon
and Blackhat seem a bit overhyped.
I personally like the Chaos Communication
Congress a looot more, though that might just
be my bias speaking, as that’s more like
the conference culture I grew up with.
Going to Defcon CTF was overall awesome, and
I happily paid for my trip - Nobody sponsored
me.
But some members from our CTF team that I
played with, were supported by the following
companies, and so thanks for making it possible
and giving them the opportunity to travel
to Defcon as well.
As their team-mate I really appreciate that.
So thanks to greenbone.
HiSolutions, Crowdstrike, VMRay and GData.
