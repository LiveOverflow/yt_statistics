Hey I'm on my way to nullcon and this is my
first time vlogging in a long time.
I feel super awkward.
I mean I felt awkward the last few times I
have vlogged, I haven't done this a lot on
this channel.
So that's why I went into this park, which
is very close by to the conference.
I thought about vlogging in the city first
on my way.
But no.
couldn't do it.
But here nobody is around; there is like this
one guy with his dog in the background, who
I feel weird about, but otherwise I'm alone.
so yeah.
You are not here to listen to my awkwardness,
I'm on my way to the conference.
So let's head there.
Hey everyone.
welcome to nullcon berlin.
This is our first edition and we have something
really cool, for everybody to go green.
If you use public transport: train, bus, bicycle,
or walking to the venue.
Or into the country.
We will give you something really cool.
Actually that just reminds me I did come with
public transport.
Yes you will get one!
I will have to show my ticket?
[yes]
So I'm really happy to meet liveoverflow,
because I learned so much from him.
And I want to say hi to all his italian fans.
[italian blah blah].
When I asked you to talk about it, I didn't
mean you to complement me.
I mean I learned so much from you, because
I just started with your videos and then I
started playing CTFs.
So yeah that's all.
I'm here with smaury.
And smaury has a cardgame he wants to show
us.
Yeah this is a cardgame we made at shielder,
which is my company, and this card game is
based on this traditional italian which is
called "briscola".
And basically in briscola you can play with
buddies.
And it's kind of the typical game usually
you play with your parents or friends like
during christmas time.
And we created this deck which is "hacker
powered", so you can find some references
about hacking culture.
For example this here is about injection.
So you can see this horse jumping around a
firewall.
Yeah we chose to publish it and to start selling
it to donate all the profits to "Informatici
Senza Frontiere", which is "Informatics without
borders".
It's like "[doctors] without borders".
But for informatics in italy.
They try to fight against the digital divide.
Mainly about the pandemic.
But not just about the pandemic.
I mean they are out there, I don't know, the
last 10 years.
They are a non-profit, so they are not making
any profits out of this thing.
And we are donating all the gross profit to
them.
So that's it.
So thank you very much.
As you heard it's a card game and the profits
go to a good cause.
So yeah, check it out.
Of course I will also link it below.
BitK.
Hey.
This is the famous minecraft YouTuber?
I saw you being on a panel about bugbounties
today, right?

[blah blah]

[more blah]
[blah]
okay.
second day.
let's go.
When I did that, I was thinking: "yeah, I'm
nobody in my docker, and I want to read some data"
and the challenge is about that.
and this is getting interesting.
So let's try to find a way to steal the password
without being able to modify anything on docker.
Ok so I'm hear with yaman.
And he also played the CTF a little bit, and
he just gives us a quick walkthrough of one
of the challenges.
So in this task we are basically given a .c
file.
So basically the way I started to solve this
challenge was like, I quickly skimmed through
the source code.
I looked at if maybe something stood out.
It's a crypto problem.
Most of the times you have to go out of the
protocol to have it exploitable.
So the first thing I saw was like.
It was basically doing a RSA signature, something
like that.
and it had the exponent of 3.
which is like never a good idea because opens
so much attacks like coppersmith, and whatever.
Okay, well.
He explained the solution to me.
But it turned out it was a bit too long and
too complicated for a quick conference video.
so I link the writeup and the link to the
challenge below.
so check it out if you are interested.
long story short, you can create a signature
with a nullbyte in it and the string compare
then fails to properly compare the resulting
signature.
And it does a str compare, which is like vulnerable
to many reasons.
Like if you have a null-byte.
When we run this, we see that we first.
This is the challenge we have to sign.
it's in hex.
this is the perfect cube, that includes the
challenge sentence.
the challenge words.
that is a perfect cube.
yeah we just sent it.
and we get the flag.
well done!
how is it going?
it's going great.
yeah.
yeah.
Just thank a lot of people and especially
null and nullcon.
I basically got my first security meetup at
nullcon.
Community meetups.
And one of the first ones was nullcon.
So all of this came because nullcon was there.
So thank you!
So we had multiple sub-events at the conference.
we had I think three CTFs, four CTFs!
One HackIM, one winja, one was by the Google
guys, as well as the [sorry didn't understand].
So please, for the winner of the 2020 nullcon
berlin on-site CTF.
please join us, team mango!
With 10.5 solves.
Anyways.
You probably noticed one price is still missing.
that you might have seen before.
As you have seen here, some have played in
a team.
Some people have played alone.
So we thought what's the best way of giving
this, to be honest, best price of all.
The lightsaber goes to, drumrull....... oh.
place number one, team mango as well.
When I was talking to mario.
When I decided let's do nullcon berlin, he
did mention, that when we spoke around, there
was an emotional feeling within the berlin
community, that they would like to have nullcon
in europe.
So thank you so much everybody.
see you in goa.
I forgot.
Now is the time to give me feedback.
Thank you.
