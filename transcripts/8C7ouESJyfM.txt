“Every Computer Can Be Hacked!”
Is an expression you probably have heard before.
But is it true?
Should we be scared about that?
Or is it false and just fear mongering?
In this video I want to explore the 0day industry
and state-of-the-art exploitation.
For that I talked to several researchers who
I believe could actually do it.
So I hope you are as excited as I am, to hear
what they have to say.
As you can see on my channel, I have quite
a bit of experience in basically every area
of hacking.
But I feel VERY VERY far away from being able
to hack something like an iPhone or a Browser.
So I do believe I have a good intuition about
this topic, but I think it’s better to hear
from people who actually have done this kind
of vulnerability research.
So I asked several people I know on twitter,
but unfortunately many couldn’t say anything,
because they actively work in this area and
their partners didn’t like that.
But I did get a few responses.
Steve or Mr. me, Pwn2Own winner - Hey LiveOverflow,
steve seely here.
Aka mr.me
S1guza, very well known in the iOS jailbreak
scene.
Itszn, or amy, from ret2, she is very experienced
in browser exploitation.
Hey my name is amy burnett.
I’m the lead on the browser exploitation
training at ret2systems.
I do research specifically into browser exploits.
Xerub.
A very experienced researcher, also into iOS.
And there was just recently a phrack prophile
about him.
If you want to check his credentials, read
that.
And steven, cts.
He also did iOS
Hey I’m Steven and I’m a security researcher.
In the past I worked at an iOS exploit shop.
Now I’d be happy to provide some of my opinions
or general insights on the so called “exploit
industry”
Oh and btw you should checkout his YouTube
channel.
Amazing content.
So all of them are extremely skilled and have
participated in top competitions such as Pwn2Own,
worked in companies developing exploits or
just did it for fun.
I think their thoughts about this topic are
more relevant than mine.
And I guess more convincing than what I would
have to say too.
But before we head into some of their insights.
I want to establish a few base facts.
First, there is this “law of security”
which says, that the more complexity a system
has, the more security relevant bugs it contains.
And when you look at a modern browsers or
a whole device like an iPhone or android.
They include an incredible amount of very
complex software.
So based on this chart, there will be bugs.
BUT they also invest a lot into fixing those
bugs.
So they bring that curve down.
Though the real issue is, there are always
new features implemented, so complexity keeps
growing, thus new bugs will also be introduced.
As amy says about this:
Browsers are definitely one of the scariest
remote attack vectors to me.
But that might be partly because of the amount
of research I have done in them.
The attack surface is really pretty scary.
And probably something that most people don’t
consider when they go and click on a link.
Now let’s have a look at Zerodium for a
moment.
They are a company that buys certain vulnerabilities
(and re-sell them for even more money).
You all know the fake hollywood style hacking,
where somebody just pushes a button and remotely
hacks into a computer or phone.
Well, that’s kinda true for these kind of
vulnerabilities, but we talk about those kind
of prices as well.
And keep in mind, for the actual end-customer
it will be even more expensive.
This is only what is paid at the end of the
chain to the researcher.
So for a Windows remote zero click exploit
they pay 1 million dollars.
For a Chrome exploit + escalating to become
admin, where the victim just has to visit
a malicious website, they pay 500.000$.
But it gets crazy with mobile payments, because
an iOS or Android zero click exploit, with
persistence, so with installing a trojan.
Just by maybe knowing your phone number, BOOM,
you got hacked.
They pay 2 to 2.5 million dollars for those
vulnerabilities
But if you don’t need persistence, because
who reboots their phone anyway, and you can
just hack it again when it got rebooted, they
pay around 1 to 1.5 million dollars.
Anyway, what’s important to keep in mind.
these exploits listed here, are not theoretical.
You can absolutely assume, that all of those
vulnerabilities exist and they are getting
sold and used.
But I didn’t show this list to impress you
with the dollar amounts.
The reason why I show this is because, when
I look at my phone, this list reminds me,
that I know FOR A FACT, that there are these
kinds of vulnerabilities in there.
If you are sceptical about that.
And you don’t trust my assumptions on this
Zerodium list, just go to any phone vendor.
They will confirm this fact.
just think about the previous phone version,
and look at the security advisories from the
vendors.
Here for example iOS.
And just last version:
There was an issue in IOMobileFrameBuffer.
“An application may be able to execute arbitrary
code with kernel privileges.
Apple is aware of a report that this issue
may have been actively exploited.”
In real life.
And oh.
I just noticed I haven’t updated my phone
yet…..
Let’s do that right now.
You should too!
And I have more proof that there are vulnerabilities
in your device right now.
There are competitions such as Pwn2Own or
the chinese Tianfu Cup.
Where at the day of the competition there
will be a completely new and fully patched
device.
And here are just the results of 2021:
Apple Safari, Microsoft Exchange, Ubuntu,
Chrome, Zoom.
And more.
Or here Tianfu Cup, iOS15, Docker, qemu, Adobe
PDF.
Basically everything gets owned and that every
year.
Anyway… it’s absolutely certain that there
are people who have access to these kind of
unknown exploits.
Or 0days.
AND there are of course also the people who
have the skills and experience to find them.
No doubts about that…
So now that we have established that.
let’s hear some thoughts from the researchers
themselves.
I hope that gives you some idea of how “special”
these vulnerabilities are.
And maybe a good start is to ask about, is
it possible to find and exploit these vulnerabilities
alone?
I would say I can if I put enough energy into
it.
In the most humblest way I would say “I
probably could”, if I really focus on it.
I initially started doing the research mostly
on my own.
But after starting ret2, I found that a team,
even a small team, can be a huge help when
it comes to building out different parts of
the exploit chain in parallel, or building
a fuzzing system, or a system to test your
exploit against different versions of your
target.
Eitherway the research is definitely doable
by individuals.
Although it may take more time or a good amount
of luck.
As you just heard for developing exploits
it makes sense to have a team.
There is a huge part that is similar to software
development.
You need debug or testing tools.
And doing that alone is just an insane amount
of work.
Maybe it’s like a developer who says “yeah
I could develop facebook on my own”.
In theory that is true, every web developer
could do that, but in reality it’s WAYYY
too much work.
Dividing the problem and doing stuff in parallel
just makes it much more realistic.
Most of the exploits nowadays are part of
a full-chain.
A full-chain is basically a series of exploits
that are necessary to ensure a full compromised
of the system.
10 years ago a full chain might have been
possible by a single guy.
So maybe 10 years ago a full-chain might be
doable by a single researcher.
But nowadays that requires an immense amount
of skill and dedication to make a full-chain
by yourself.
And these targets get harder every year.
Nowadays researchers tend to specialize a
lot as well.
That's why most of the 0day industry operates
in teams.
So for example you might focus on like “oh
I do the linux kernel”, oh I do webkit,
I do safari, I do v8.
As steven said, to compromise a modern iPhone
or even a browser, you need several vulnerabilities
that you have to combine to break through
the individual layers.
And these layers are so complex, that researchers
often have to specialize.
I think nowadays a single researcher, if they
are dedicated enough, they can still make
a weaponized exploit.
If you look at ian beers research on bluetooth
on iOS.
You can see that just a single guy, to be
fair he is one of the best in the world, he
can still make like a fully wormable iOS bug.
Right.
And all I have to do is just be near their
phone and their phone is compromised.
So that type of thing is still possible in
2021.
But I’d say that type of thing is extremely
difficult.
Xerub also said about this:
“I work alone most of the time, but I do
occasionally chat -- and take input from -- a
few select friends.
It is certainly possible to do it alone, but
I guess it's somewhat easier in a team.
I say somewhat, because even in a team, usually
only one or two people bear the brunt of the
exploit per se, while the others are working
to polish.
I am not trying to minimise the importance
of the extra work, it just happens that I
don't usually need, nor release 'easy-to-use'
one-click solutions for any client, less more
so for the masses.”
And here is an important detail.
Xerub used the word “weaponized-exploit”
which I think, when talking within our industry
it’s kinda clear what it means.
But outside of our industry, this term is
also very loaded.
“Weapon”.
Weapons are used in war and directly kill
people.
Exploits, and the intelligence gathered through
implants can of course be reason for a military
strike or other violent actions.
But I do think there is a big difference between
the violence of “real” weapons and exploits.
So many in our industry prefer the term “production-grade”
or “operationalized” exploits.
So these terms refer to an exploit that is
very easy, usable, and very stable.
So basically a customer, who has no idea about
iOS exploitation, they can just enter a phone
number on a graphical interface, press a button
and a phone gets hacked.
And that requires a lot of additional work
put into the exploit.
So now we kinda understand the industry.
At the start of the chain you have researches
who find vulnerabilities and create a very
basic proof of concept exploit.
Then they maybe sell it to a company specialized
in operationalizing it, and this company takes
the exploit, doing all the Q&A, maybe improves
the exploit so the target doesn’t crash
and confirms which phones and versions it
really works against.
And they probably also develop their own trojan,
or usually called an “agent”, which makes
remote access to the phone and the data very
comfortable for a customer.
They then package this all together into a
software solution, sell access to this tool,
to for example intelligence agencies around
the world.
And the customer then get basically a Hollywood
style button to hack any iPhone.
So you get a whole value chain.
you have a cost and risk for the researcher
to find an exploit.
You have a demand from customers wanting certain
hacking capabilities.
And you have companies in the middle that
balances the price into both directions, while
also having their own cost for operationalizing
everything.
Which determines their profits.
So now that we have established that there
is a 99.9% certainty that there are vulnerabilities
in the devices you use.
And it’s probably still possible for individuals
to find and exploit those vulnerabilities.
but most likely it will be done by a team.
It becomes clear that the original question
about whether “every computer can be hacked”,
is uninteresting.
It doesn’t help us in real life.
Every human could be killed, doesn’t mean
every human gets killed.
Is that a bad comparison?
Anyway.
Complex devices will probably always be hackable,
as long as they keep adding features and making
them more and more complex.
So the real question we should ask ourselves
is not whether your device can be hacked.
The question must be, how likely is it going
to happen to you.
Will your device be hacked?
This of course is a very complex and very
subjective question about risk.
Everybody has a different risk feeling.
But who else would be better to help us understand
this risk, than the people who actually have
the ability to find such vulnerabilities.
How scared should you be?
I would say it doesn’t make sense to live
in fear of 0day.
Because I would say, you know, using technology
is just a very small part of my life, I not
gonna let that dominate my life, right.
S1guza says about this:
I think it’s highly unlikely that I’m
becoming a target because there’s just a
lot more smarter people out there with a lot
more important information on their hands.
And
I feel like burning a 0day to target me would
be kind of a waste.
But each of their own.
And xerub says about this:
“I am certainly worried about using browsers.
Both because of my own work, but mostly because
I have seen the work of people way more talented
than me, and I can tell you it's scary!
[...] Besides the browser, the rest of the
phone as a whole, I am less worried about.
I mean, Apple is doing a decent job, especially
with the hardware mitigations.
It is a common misconception that 0days are
expensive.
Yes, they are, but it really depends on ROI.
[...] Say you catch 50 targets with a 0day
you don't care much about.
It eventually gets discovered, sure, but in
present terms: $500k for 50 targets is $10k
per target.
which is not that much for a serious actor.”
But in the end, I guess, if someone really
wanted to target me, like a serious adversary,
who are persistent and relentless.
Then I likely fall prey.
But there is a point in time where you just
make peace with that and accept what it is.
So I think the best way to approach this type
of problem is to think in terms of the economics
for the attacker.
So imagine you are the attacker and you have
a business to run.
So how much does the attack, and how much
would the attack generate in revenue for me.
The cost of mounting this attack is very high.
So you need a very high return for this investment
to make it worthwhile.
So for example if I’m some random crime
guy, I’m not going to take this chrome 0day
and pay a bazillion dollars on it.
And then try to use that on random users.
For example let’s say I hack your computer.
What can I get out of your computer.
I can use it for I guess cryptomining I could
do ransomewhere, I could harvest your cookies
or autofill and so on.
But how much is that really worth?
It’s probably only worth a few bucks per
a system.
Maybe a bit more in ransomware.
But it’s hard to say.
And that initial investment is extremely high.
And the thing is once you started your campaign
it’s a race against the time because all
these browsers all auto-update.
Assuming that people have the auto-update
on.
Which is like most people.
Because that’s the default.
So as you can see, they respect the technology
and know that there is a risk, but also they
don’t really worry that much.
Especially 99% of the people watching this
video on YouTube, you really shouldn’t worry
too much.
But of course there are people who should
maybe worry a bit more.
There are groups of people we know who get
attacked with those exploits.
Citizenlab has several great reports about
that.
Now on the other hand, people of interest
should worry about their security.
And those would be like journalists, dissidents,
government officials, politicians, executives,
and so on.
Or exploit developers.
Yes you heard right.
There is also incentive for attackers to target
security researchers, as researchers often
have access to privileged information, or
maybe other vulnerabilities or exploits that
they produced themselves.
And we have seen this happened earlier this
year with the twitter and linkedin campaigns.
Which were using a chrome 0day to target security
researchers, which they had tricked into going
to their blog page.
This happened for example to cts
some hackers from north korea actually slid
into my twitter DMs, and also the DMs of a
bunch of other security researchers.
And they tried to basically use a chromium
0day on us.
So they were like “come checkout my blog
it got my new research on it, what do you
think about it.” and then the blogpost had
a chromium drive-by zeroday.
So that was pretty sketch.
So what can you do if you are a journalist
or in some other high-risk group?
I think there is not much that you can do
to completely rule out the possibility of
0day used against you.
I think a few things can help, but nothing
can guarantee your security against 0day.
I think that security by isolation also helps,
for example you know like, I don’t keep
my exploit on my personal device.
In terms of reducing attack surface ,a big
thing is disabling javascript by default.
This has gotten harder with the modern web,
which requires a lot of javascript which gives
you anything besides a blank white page.
There are extensions like umatrix which give
you a good amount of control over this, and
can make it a bit easier to manage your javascript
usage.
If you want to go even further, you can usually
disable specific web features using either
browsing flags or commandline arguments.
And this helps cuts down the attack surface
even when javascript is enabled for a site.
For example one thing I do is disabl;e the
just-in-time compiler, and also web assembly
as part of chrome.
And this will help cut down on attacks targeting
the compiler or the webassemply system.
Now this is not gonna stop all attacks potentially,
but it will cut down on the attack surface.
On a device like an iphone it might be a little
bit harder to have such granular control.
But something that I have done in the past
is having two browsers, one of which, lets
say is safari which has javascript disabled.
And then if I decide I need to run it, we
can move it into the other environment.
I just try to follow best practices as much
as possible, right?
So using Universal two-factor auth, password
managers, I don’t click stupid links, all
that kind of stuff really plays into it a
lot.
As long as you can make it harder for the
attacker, right?
And that is what defens ein depth theory goe
sinto.
Just making it harder for the attacker.
Now if you notice you got exploited and a
trojan, or so called agent, is running on
your device, I guess the best thing is to
immediately disconnect from the internet,
and I guess reinstall the device.
But if you don’t know if you got infected,
there is maybe one very small, but possibly
effective, trick.
Checkout the recent amnesty international
report about the Pegasus malware:
“Pegasus is no longer maintaining persistence
on iOS devices.”
And here is what Bill from Citiznelab is saying
about that:
“The NSO Group's Pegasus spyware delivered
via 0-click exploits is no longer "persistent"
in the strict sense of the word (it doesn't
come back when you reboot).
“Persistence” is achieved via firing the
0-click again.
the lack of traditional "persistence" is a
feature.
It makes the spyware more nimble, and prevents
recovery of the the spyware and exploits from
forensic analysis.
And steven also said the same:
If you have a phone rebooting it every now
and then can help mitigate the impact of an
implant.
Because not all implants have good persistence
capabilities
So kids remember, always reboot your phone.
I hope this gave you a good overview about
the threat of 0days.
And now let’s come back to the question.
Can every device be hacked?
We established that for complex devices such
as phones and computers that is like 99% true.
But at the same time it’s so complex that
it requires a huge amount of time and experience
to do that.
And nowadays to get an actual full-chain “weaponized”
or rather “production-grade” or “operationalized”
exploit ready for use, it’s really only
possible to do that with a team of people.
Which means it’s very costly to do so and
usually only worth it if there is a considerable
return for that investment.
Which means it’s almost exclusively used
today in state-level hacking by intelligence
agencies gathering, well, intelligence on
various people of interest, regimes to go
against journalists and activists, and probably
corporate espionage.
So if you are not belonging to such a group,
you should not worry about 0days.
And I can with high confidence tell you, that
your bragging friend or ex partner, does not
have this kind of capability.
they will use other much much simpler tricks
like phishing to get to you.
Those are the kinds of attacks you should
worry about, and I recently made a video about
protecting yourself against phishing, that’s
like 1000x more important for your security
than thinking about 0days.
And lastly, 0days are only expensive because
they use unknown vulnerabilities, it’s a
premium you pay for that.
And they have a limited lifetime until they
are patched.
But there are many many more KNOWN vulnerabilities,
we call them n-days, with exploits that are
much much cheaper.
So it might be totally feasible to attack
you with those.
Luckily every important device and software
has auto updates by default enabled.
I know they are annoying.
But please don’t disable them.
This keeps the bar high enough for you, so
you don’t have to worry.
