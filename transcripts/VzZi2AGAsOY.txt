Last video we figured out how to overwrite
certain functions with LD_PRELOAD and how
to access the internal objects from libGameLogic.
With that we were able to increase our walking
speed a lot.
So let’s see what else we can do.
One really cool thing would be flying, right?
Flying… so how could we get flying.
There is obviously not an attribute in the
Player class to simply enable flying, but
we can maybe be creative with what we have.
And jumping is definitely close to flying,
we just can't fly very high.
And we will fall back down.
So Maybe we can make something out of that.
I have noticed there is a jumpHoldTime and
jumpSpeed.
So let’s set jumpSpeed to a higher values
and check what it does.
Let’s compile our evil library, then we
LD_PRELOAD it into the game and then let’s
see what changed.
When we now jump, whooooosh… ok I think
the speed was a bit too crazy.
But we get a nice view of the map.
Including an island?
We haven’t found that island during our
let’s play in episode 1.
I wonder what we can find there.
So let’s tone down the speed a bit.
And now also add the jumpHoldTime with a higher
value.
Then we can try it again.
Ok…
So jumping seems fairly normal.
Except that I can keep space pressed, or you
know hold space for a longer time.
And then I keep rising up.
That’s pretty cool flying already, but the
issue is, that once I release space again
we start falling down and we can’t jump
anymore until we touch the ground again….
Mhmh
This is kind of the challenge with game hacking.
We have essentially all power of the world,
we can modify any memory, call any function
we want, we just need to be creative with
what and how we do it, so we can make it usable
and fun.
So when I was looking around a bit more I
found that the Player class has a function
called CanJump(), which returns a boolean,
true or false.
So let’s try to overwrite that function
and always return 1.
When we now try this ingame, we can fly up
when we press space, decline when we release
it, but then we can also press it again to
jump again and thus, fly up!
While the flying is not perfect, because the
player has an awful velocity while in the
air, it’s still pretty neat.
If anybody finds a way to be able to move
horizontally as if you are walking on the
ground, let me know!
Let’s fly a bit higher to see again which
direction the island was.
Hehe so cool.
The island looks awesome from above.
Oh… there is a dark spot over there.
Is that an island?
ENHANCE!
It could be the island!
Let’s fall back to the ground, which takes
a little bit, but then thanks to our super
speed we just quickly run there!
We are approaching it.
ISLAN HERE WE COME!
Entering Cowabungalow!
Oh look there is a chest!
And the Cow King!
Remember the Gold Farm from the Let’s Play
in episode 1?
Welcome to the gold farm.
I farm all day to provide for this island.
But it has all gone wrong.
What’s wrong?
My Cows are missing!
One night I heard a massive amount of thunder
, then my cows had disappeared.
I have no idea where they went.
I will let you know if I see them.
So sounds like we found the Cows!
Ouch!
The Cow King just killed us!
Damn…
With the attack Static Link.
It’s a 1337 Magic Spell.
And dealing a lot of shock damage.
Let’s respawn. and checkout that house here.
Welcome to my humble bungalow.
I was enjoying my private island until those
mad cows showed up.
Where did the cows come from?
One night I heard a thunderous boom, and when
I looked outside there were mad cows everywhere.
There is one in particular that worries me.
That sounds familiar.
I think I know who owned these cows.
Which one worries you?
The one with the crown!
Anything that gets close gets struck by a
bolt of lightning out of the blue.
Do you know any magic?
I do.
Why do you ask?
I have a legendary magical cube here.
I read that it posseses.
TYPO!
THERE IS A TYPO.
LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE!
I read that it posseses the power of the fable
Rubick, and might be able to steal the thunder
of the Cow King, leaving it defenseless.
Have you tried to use it on the cow?
I would, but I’m terrible with magic.
My last attempt got me stranded on this island.
That fast travel spot right there is such
a tease, as whatever magic got me here is
preventing me from using it.
Would you please take the cube and try it?
I will take it and try to use it.
Here it is, I won’t need it back.
No more magic for me.
Good luck, now go steal the Cow King’s thunder.
Thank you.
I will see what I can do.
Acquired Rubick’s Cube.
I am Legend.
AND WHAT THE HECK.
Killed by a Mad Cow.
Thank you.
Ok.
Now let’s go to the Cow King again.
It’s attacking me, let’s spam using the
Rubicks Cube, and I steal the Static Link
skill!
Now I can use Static Link.
There we go.
Quest complete.
Until the Cows Come home.
And a New Achievement.
Monster Kill.
We also get a weapon, the Cowboy Coder.
But let’s check out the chest.
Acquired Flag of the Cow!
1337 Flag.
The key is: I should’ve used dynamic link.
Wuhooo…
Our first flag.
And if we would have found this during the
CTF, we could now submit this flag to the
scoreboard to get points for our team.
Awesome!
We are slowly making progress.
Before we end this, maybe we could also take
a quick look at the original list of challenges
to get an overview what our goals are.
This was the CTF page for the Ghost in the
shellcode CTF 2015.
And here is the challenge we just solved,
“Until the Cows Come Home”.
We would have gotten 100 points for that,
and it was the easiest one.
I think next time I try to go for Unbearable
Revenge.
Btw.

yourself, you can find all the files in the
