TROOPERS is a security conference in Heidelberg
Germany which I attended in 2017.
One fun event that happens there every year
is Packetwars, it’s kind of like a CTF competitions
during one evening, but only for a few teams.
And I didn’t have a group to play with.
But it was held in this restaurant we were
all at and the task was shown on a beamer.
This was one.
Battle I: Whale Spotting.
Identify the email address of @darealtrump
and achieve bonus objectives on the way.
We have 45minutes to solve it.
And we get points for various objectives.
some for the email address, for evidence of
whistleblower assassination and if we identify
a favorite coffee shop to organize a boycott.
So my friend TheVamp and I had nothing else
than our phone but we were really craving
to play.
So we tried it.
First we looked up the obvious twitter handle
and found this account.
Oh and this is all going to be screenshots
I made from my phone while playing.
The latest tweet we can find says that we
should ignore the tweet before, because it
was not relevant.
So obviously the first step is to look into
for example the web archive, because we hoped
it had saved the deleted tweet.
And yeah, there was.
It was a URL to some kind of report.
We clicked on it and downloaded the pdf.
Unfortunately certain parts were blacked out,
but I assumed they were just overlays, because
that’s such a typical pdf redaction fail.
So I simply tried to copy the whole page into
a notes app.
And yeah that worked, it revealed the text
underneath.
But it turned out that the text was actually
an image.
And it had this cipher text on it, which looked
like some kind of simple substitution cipher
like caesar or vigenere.
So we had to get the text out of the image
and we didn’t want to type it on the phone.
So we pulled up an online OCR service and
uploaded the image . And now we copied the
text into an online cipher solver, which bruteforces
the key and applying some heuristic if the
result sounds like valid english.
And we got this text out.
It’s not quite perfect because the key is
a bit jumbled and maybe OCR was also not perfect,
but you can guess most of the text:
After some further research, blah blah, and
eliminate them.
So that is evidence of assassination and we
solved that task.
But there were more tasks, so where is the
other stuff?
We checked back to the web archive and found
another entry of deleted tweets, with the
favorite coffee shop starbucks, which was
another task.
And what looks like login credentials.
So we logged into this account, I tweeted
that I was here, got the account’s email
from the settings and we solved the last part.
And now comes the not so humble brag.
We were faster than the actual teams!
I think the reason for that might be, that
with a phone you are sooo limited that you
can’t try out crazy stuff.
Steganography, metadata and so forth is just
out of reach, so we only tried what was possible
for us and got lucky.
I’m sure the other teams over complicated
things because they had laptops.
I think it’s something to keep in mind but
it was really fun to solve something like
this on just a phone.
Because we solved it first, the organizers
even gave us the flag for participating, even
though we were not officially part of packetwars.
So that was really awesome!
And we also got this awesome shout-out at
the end of the conference when they were announcing
the winners.
The actual first people to solve the first
challenge were the spectators.
So our players actually got off to kind of
a rough start.
Are those two guys out here?
That’s us!
We were sitting somewhere ther here in the
back.
OK!
Let’s hear it for those guys, because...
And they did a debrief much better than I
or mathias could ever do.
I think you gave me the debfrief and all the
proofs in about 45 seconds.
So I think you have a future in this sports!
I really appreciate it, that was really fun.
So i can only recommend the TROOPERS conference
in heidelberg.
It’s a solid conference and if you have
a chance to go there, you should.
Unfortunately it’s a professional conference
which means ticket prices are really high
and not something you generally buy privately,
but the cool thing is they have limited spots
available for students and you can write a
motivational letter and maybe get a free ticket.
So that’s really cool and I encourage you
to do that.`
