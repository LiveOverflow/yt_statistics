Hey,
I’m LiveOverflow, and I’m the inventor
of security.txt
NO!
GET OUT OF HERE!
I’m LiveOverflow, I’m the inventor of
security.txt.
Let me explain what it is.
Security.txt is a proposed standard which
allows websites to define security policies.
The security.txt file sets clear guidelines
for security researchers on how to report
security issues.

Security.txt is a simple text file that you
can find on many websites in the .well-known
directory.
But before we talk more in depth about security.txt
- my invention - I wanted to quickly talk
about the .well-known directory.
I would actually be surprised if you didn’t
know, because this directory is actually “well
known”.
There is even a standard for this.
And of course as computer interested people
we read ALL standards for fun.
So this is old news for you.
But because it’s so much fun, let’s check
it out together again.
This memo defines a path prefix for "well-known
locations", "/.well-known/"
Many of you probably know the robots.txt file.
Which provides easily accessible policy information
about how a bot accessing the website should
behave.
So this file provides useful metadata information
for bots.
Now you could imagine that there are many
other cases where such a file could be useful
for other kinds of … things.
And you could maybe endup with tons of these
files in the root directory.
so at some point there was this suggestion
to place these files into their own URI path
called .well-known.
Now you shouldn’t just place any file in
there, because it should be a well known useful
file, so there is a procedure to register
well-known URIs.
Basically send a request for registration
to the wellknown-uri-review mailinglist.
So security.txt is such a policy informational
file, which registered a well-known uri.
Let’s check it out.
We can go to the mailinglist archive and see
here other requests.
let’s search for my request….
Oh… not found?
I’m sure I registered it.
Am I going crazy?
Ah.
I forgot.
I’m a smarty pants.
We did it over IANA in 2017.
This will get done as part of the RFC publication,
no need to track separately.
Security.txt is not an RFC yet.
So security.txt is not a full standard yet.
It’s still in the process of becoming one.
But what is it actually about?
Security researchers and bug bounty hunters
have often been very annoyed at finding the
correct contact to report security issues.
Some people simply try to write an email to
security@.com but that’s just
a guess.
Some have bug bounty programs, but you frst
have to find the correct page.
There is not an easy clear place to find this
information.
And so this is where security.txt comes in.
This text file describes a standard to help
organizations define the process for security
researchers to disclose security vulnerabilities
securely.
Here is for example the file from our domain
securiytxt.org.
If you want to report a security issue for
this domain, you can contact me here.
And here is my PGP key for encryption.
It’s that simple.
Simple, but very useful.
And what is awesome, we are already see wide
adoption.
For example here on Dropbox, Facebook and
even Google.
I’m so proud of my invention.
And so now it’s on its way to becoming an
actual internet standard.
it could become a real RFC within this year.
Anyway.
Hopefully MY INCREDIBLE INVENTION makes the
life of bug hunters and security researchers
easier.
And maybe you even adopt it in your company,
