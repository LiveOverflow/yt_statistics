Welcome back to the next episode of 
Minecraft Hacked. I have to admit something.
I played some more off screen. You 
can actually see the result behind me.
I wanted to build some nice stuff, I have said 
that in the past few episodes. But then I never
done it. Constantly I’m getting distracted by 
looking at minecraft source code and looking
for vulnerabilities and stuff. SO here, finally, 
I took a bit of time and made a nice walkway from
the start of my base going up the hill where 
we have the potato farm and villager breeder.
And you know what, I want to show you 
something up there. So just follow me.
I started watching Hermitcraft, I have NEVER 
watched minecraft series like that before.
But it starts to really grow on me. Watching the 
different perspectives and characters and builds.
It’s really nice. I get why it’s so 
popular. I cannot wait for the next episode.
And yeah, seeing builds there made me 
want to make something nice as well.
So what do you think? Does my 
path look nice? I know it’s basic
Before we head up to the village breeder, let 
me get some potatoes first. I thought it might
be useful to start trading emeralds. I made sure 
both of them trade potatoes so I can very easily
stockpile some emeralds for later. Nice. Okay. 
Now let’s head up the hill. And wait for it.
You probably wonder, WHAT THE F IS THIS?!
Okay. Yeah. I started to breed villagers. 
I added a farm on the backside with another
farmer. Like the potato farm we built before, 
they will also harvest the potatoes and throw
them to the other villagers. But here I 
actually want the villagers to have it,
because they need food to breed.
And yeah, when they have enough food,
they produce a baby. This baby then walks 
out as you have seen in a previous episode.
And eventually sits in a boat. And stays 
there. This is perfect to capture villagers.
I let this farm run for a couple of hours, and it 
seemed to work well. You can see over time quite a
few villagers get trapped in the boats. Nice.
But why do I want so many villagers?
Let me show you where I bring them.
I made here a pathway along the hill
and so I can transport them with the boat. Boats 
on land are not the fastest, but they are great
for transporting villagers. And wait for it. There 
we are. Look at that. THIS! Should probably be
illegal. I’m gathering tons of villagers here, 
because I want to create a big trading area.
For enchanted books, but also other stuff.
By the way, I made this pathway for the boat,
so I can tell you the fake story that I travel 
with the boat over there. But then I remembered
“AY WAIT! They know I developed a flying 
hack!”. So of course, I flew with the boats
over there. Yeah. So I have been doing that.
But I also think we got enough villagers for
now. So I decided to turn the breeder farm off. 
To do that I just transformed it a little bit
into a regular potato farm. You know, adding the 
hopper minecart to snatch the thrown potatos.
But also I put a composter there, because I 
figured getting some bonemeal would be useful too.
Anyway.
I told you I have bigger plans. It annoyed
me that my base looked so terrible. So I looked on 
YouTube what to build, and I really wanted an iron
farm, but also one that looked nice. And I found 
this video with a really nice build by Avomance.
It’s an iron farm in a very pretty house. So I 
used this opportunity to try out something new
and I built the farm in creative mode first. I 
mentioned this before, there are mods that help
you build. For example litematica is one a lot 
of people use. So after I finished building and
decorating the house in creative mode, I created 
a schematic from it which I can now use in my
survival world. So going back to the server, now 
I can decide where I want to place it. I think
here somewhere would be a nice spot. course this 
doesn’t build it for you, it just helps you to
visualize where to place the blocks. It’s still 
survival and I have to have the blocks. It can
also display a material list what you need. This 
is very helpful so I can make sure I have enough
of it in my inventory. But luckily we mined a lot 
of blocks and wood in the past episodes! We have
to transform some blocks with the stonecutter into 
a different kind, but we definitely have enough.
So let’s start building!
While I was just mindlessly placing blocks,
I thought a about Griefing. Basically the opposite 
of building. Griefing is destroying somebody elses
build. It used to be a big genre on YouTube, where 
people just go on random servers and grief them
with fire, lava casting and tnt. It still exists, 
but I don’t feel like it’s that popular anymore.
I think there is an interesting parallel between 
griefing and finding vulnerabilities in other
people’s software. In both cases, you are 
breaking something somebody else made.
Of course. Most of the time, griefing is 
awful. And yet some people seem to find it
funny. I don’t know how humor works, but I know 
from experience, I can laugh about pretty dark
jokes myself. I understand that they are 
awful. And yet I laugh. I don’t know why.
I guess I can somewhat understand that misery can 
be funny sometimes? And griefing plays into that.
I don’t want to sound like an old man, but I guess 
it’s something mostly younger people find funny?
The reason I think is, once you have been 
on the receiving side of it, you understand
the pain that it can cause. The older you 
are, the more likely you have been bullied,
pranked, cheated on, lied to whatever. You have 
a much better understanding for what it means
to feel this kind of emotional pain, so you 
probably try to do it less to other people.
And yet I said griefing is not funny “most of 
the time”. So when is griefing not terrible?
Isn’t destroying somebodies hard work, that they 
spent dozens of hours on always awful? Well,
I think what sucks about griefing is, that it’s 
unbalanced. What takes hundreds of hours to build,
can take seconds to destroy. But hear me out.
Have you ever been the target of a prank?
Was it a good or negative experience. When 
is a prank fun, and when is it bullying.
Pouring water over somebody you don’t 
like at school, that’s bullying. It’s
not a prank. You are just an asshole.
But coming up with an elaborate plan,
putting a plastic container on a 
remote controlled car. And then.
Okay… I’m not that creative. I don’t know. Imagine 
a super cool elaborate plan to get somebody wet.
Well now, it could be funny. The reason for that 
is that it actually took a considerable amount
of effort to pull off this prank. The targeted 
person could have a response where they feel like
“WOW, they spent so much time just to 
prank me”. That definitely could be a
positive experience. People care about you.
And I think what this shows is, that there
needs to be balance. Low effort, huge damage, 
that sucks. It sucks to be griefed for nothing.
But if somebody puts in a lot of effort. 
Has to come up with super creative ideas.
Or MAYBE the prank even takes MUCH MUCH 
more effort than repairing the damage takes.
Well then everything feels a bit different.
So when you just have the IP of somebody's
minecraft server, you go on there 
and destroy everything. That’s
lazy. Not funny. Not a great prank.
But if you write your own scripts to
scan the internet for minecraft servers, 
you check what player is currently online,
you do that over a long period of time, just in 
order to find the private server of the mojang
developer jeb_. With the goal to grief him?
Well… I think now it really becomes debatable.
It’s still somewhat of a dick move. It still maybe 
made jeb_ angry or sad. But at the same time,
hats off to the effort. This was not 
lazy. This was actually kinda cool.
And here we can slowly make 
the bridge over to hacking.
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
the MIT, there is the concept of “hacks”.
Hacks at the MIT are practical jokes and 
pranks meant to prominently demonstrate
technical aptitude and cleverness.
Although many traditional college
pranks have involved maximizing embarrassment 
or inconvenience for a victim or target,[...],
such antics are usually disparaged 
by MIT hackers as "unimaginative" or
"boring". [...] Even when an individual is 
targeted [...], the jest is good-natured,
often eliciting admiration rather 
than anger from the "victim".
And this is the difference. The group who went 
through all this effort to find the server from
jeb_, it’s clever. It’s different. It’s a lot of 
effort. You almost have to admire them for it.
Now I don’t know this group. I don’t 
know what their motivation really was.
I don’t know how much damage they actually caused. 
I guess there are still lines you maybe should not
cross. Maybe destroy only one building or so. 
I don’t know. I guess you cannot say that the
group who griefed jeb_ is completely absolved 
of their crime. But at the same time I also
think it’s not pure evil. The effort somehwat 
balances it. What do you think? Comment below.
And there are more examples of this. On the 
oldest anarchy servers in minecraft, 2b2t.
On there its allowed and even expected to grief 
bases. There are tons of amazing stories how
certain bases were discovered or leaked. And 
then destroyed. Sometimes it was just low effort
from the griefer. But sometimes the griefers 
had amazing techniques, maybe even discovered
and exploited vulnerabilities to find bases. In 
those cases, you can have respect for the skills.
Unfortunately, most people are unskilled lazy 
noobs. Script kiddies. People who dont put
any effort into anything in their life. And then 
feel powerful and boast about their lazy griefs.
Those exist amass and I dont want to defend them. 
But I do think there are some crazy smart evil
people. And when they do evil stuff. They do it 
with a creativity and skill where you just have
to press thumbsup on this video to pay respect.
Anyway. I wanted to also relate this to breaking
software. I know that many developers feel 
pride in their creations. And they should.
But I also know that when somebody reports or 
documents vulnerabilities in their software,
maybe even making fun of it (that’s a bad habit 
in our industry), it can feel really awful.
It feels like the researcher just wants to destroy 
your software. I can totally understand why a
developer would feel that way. But I also think 
it’s kinda misunderstanding what’s going on?
First of all, the obvious, a security researcher 
does not create the vulnerability. The
vulnerability was there in the code all along. 
The hacker just discovered it. And secondly,
usually finding, documenting and reporting 
vulnerabilities requires time and effort. It can
require a lot of skill and creativity to uncover 
it. And the researcher probably didn’t look for
them in your software because they wanted to 
hurt you. They looked for it because it was a fun
technical challenge, and somehow your code 
was so interesting for them to spend time on.
It should be seen as something positive.
But when you compare it to the previous examples,
you can also see that there are cases 
where maybe the security researcher is an
asshole. If somebody downloads a vulnerability 
scanner, just copies an exploit from the internet,
and in the end boasts about their amazing skills, 
maybe laughing at the bad developers or admins.
Yeah, suddenly you are not the cool hacker 
anymore. Congrats you are a script kiddie.
Anyway… the story of how jeb_’s server 
was discovered actually motivated me to
try to implement something like this myself.
I have always wanted a reason to develop some
internet wide scanning tool. Scanning minecraft 
servers is maybe not super useful for IT security,
but this whole project is about having fun. 
Of course creating an internet wide scanner
to discover assets for bug bounty hunting would 
be more “professional”, but in the end it doesn’t
matter. You have to solve the same technical 
problems so the experience I gain from this
is still useful. it’s a really good opportunity 
to practice coding and try out some new stuff.
So I wanted to build a scanner 
with multiple services.
Let’s make a plan. First we need a discovery 
component. We need something that can scan
for IPs with open port 25565. The 
default minecraft server port.
And when this service discovers a 
candidate, it should be placed into a queue.
Then we want something to consume this queue 
to check if it’s really a minecraft server.
Maybe you have noticed this before, but without 
joining a server you already see some information
about it when it’s in your server list. That’s 
because there is a feature in the protocol to
get this information from the server. It’s here 
in the Server List Ping wiki. Requesting the
server information makes the server return this 
JSON data, which contains the server version,
protocol version, the description of this 
server, but also a sample of online players.
So we need a component that can do that. 
Just query the server status information.
And then maybe we want the system to be extensible 
if we want to do more stuff. Maybe some of you
know what that stuff is, because I accidentally 
made a lot of people very angry. But that has
to wait for next episode.
In this episode I want
to introduce the base scanner.
So how do we implement the two components now.
I know about masscan but I have never used 
it before. Masscan is a TCP port scanner,
spews SYN packets asynchronously, scanning 
entire Internet in under 5 minutes.
It’s a very clever design. A TCP connection 
is established by sending a SYN packet
and then the server responds with a SYN ACK.
So instead of waiting for this response.
Masscan can just spews out SYN 
packets to tons of IP addresses.
And then patiently waits for SYN ACK responses. 
If you get a response, probably that port is open.
Now we need to be somewhat responsible and be a 
good cyber citizen. Don’t be an asshole. This can
be like a denial of service attack filling up 
any available network capacity. So especially
when you do this from a server in a datacenter, 
be nice. And ratelimit the search. You don’t need
to scan the internet in 5 minutes. But what is 
a good ratelimit? Hard to say. Here you can see
mine. I use a python wrapper around masscan and I 
send 260.000 SYN packets per second. It was lower
before, but I scan IP addresses in batches and it 
took a bit too long. Even now I think I have not
scanned the whole internet even ONCE, even though 
I had it running for like a month or so. So I
think it’s fine, but I’m also not sure. I don’t 
know. It’s just very important that you think
about this and you understand what you are doing. 
So you don’t accidentally crash any networks.
Anyway. When masscan identifies a potentially open 
port I want to place this as a job in a queue.
So how do we now get the miencraft status 
information? And then where do we store the data?
I want to make this clear, I did this to whole 
project to learn and practice. My solution
is not perfect, it’s actually terrible. But I 
only learned this because I tried this. And I
think if you want to become a good developer you 
need to make experiments like this. So here is
my docker-compose file. First of all you can see 
here redis and mongo. Mongo is basically my object
database. This where I store all the results 
into. Because the whole process was explorative,
and not every server responds with the perfectly 
same information, using mongo is good. We can
just throw any json data into the storage. Redis 
is used as the backend for the task scheduling.
It is used by Dramatiq. Dramatiq is a background 
task processing library for Python with a focus
on simplicity, reliability and performance.
I have never used it before. I know about celery,
and I have used that before. But it always 
felt a bit of a hassle, and so I was intrigued
by “simplicity and reliability”. For me who 
is only developing small scripts and tools
this is important. I’m not trying to build a 
scalable service used by millions of users.
I need a simpl and reliable solution. And 
so I used this project to checkout dramatiq.
Then we have here some python app. I mentioned 
it before, I use python as a masscan wrapper
so this is just a basic loop that picks a random 
ip range, starts masscan and for any candidate is
Launching here a minecraft server status check. 
Basically putting the task into the queue. So
let’s look at this mc_status function. Here you 
can see the dramatiq.actor decorator. So this
is a job executed by dramatiq. And here things get 
weird. So to get the minecraft server information,
I’m using quarry. I have used quarry in 
episode 1 for the network protocol analysis,
so I was already familiar with the code and wanted 
to use it. Anyway. this is where the whole project
fell apart. That’s why you see here time_limits, 
timeout_process. And whatever. Turns out dramatiq
is not as reliable as I needed it to be.
You see in this worker function we don’t
just calculate some basic stuff. We connect to a 
TCP remote server, which might not even be there
and timeout or the connected minecraft 
server is weird. Or quarry has some bugs.
there can be tons of issues with networking. 
And look at this warning in the dramatiq docs:
Warning
Time limits are best-effort.
They cannot cancel system calls or any function 
that doesn’t currently hold the GIL under CPython.
To be honest, I don’t know if that is the issue. 
I tried to get around this by starting an entirely
NEW PROCESS doing the whole networking in 
it’s own space. And then terminating that
process after a 10 second timeout. But for 
whatever reason, dramatiq keeps hanging.
Its running fine for a few hours, and 
suddenly NO OTHER TASKS are scheduled anymore.
Every day I have to restart the dramatiq worker.
I’m not sure what the problem is. It’s very likely
just my fault. BUT that’s the point of this whole 
experiment for me. Dramatiq is probably awesome,
if you use it right. But it’s not the 
simplicity and ROBUSTNESS I was looking for.
So this was kind of a failed 
project for me. It worked,
I scanned minecraft servers. But as I said, I 
constantly had to restart the worker service.
So on one hand it’s failure, but on the other 
hand, this experience is SUPER valuable to me.
I know if I want to build internet wide scanning 
again, I need to use a different worker system.
Anyway.
As I said, all the information is then put into
a mongo database and I found mongo-express, which 
is a nice web user interface for mongo. This way
I can very easily look at the data. And here it 
is! Sorry for blurring the minecraft server IPs,
but through this project I also learned that 
people really really don’t like their PUBLIC
SERVERS to be scanned. And my intention is of 
course NOT to cause any harm. And if I show here
a handful of public servers, good chance some of 
you go there and grief it. SO yeah. I blur it.
Anyway, here is the server status, so 
the version and server description and
it shows how many players are online. You can try 
different queries, like the different versions.
And you can see how many servers I found there.
We could also try to look for a new 1.19 server?
BTW it’s martch when I record this videos. 
SO MAYBE MOJANG LEAKS IT?! No. No finding.
I also log every player I encounter 
in the player list of the server.
Oh My GOD! Grian? Is that the real grian? 
Looking at the UUID it looks like the real one.
Could this be the hermitcraft server? 
Though some servers have fake players,
so I’m not sure. But looking at the other players 
on this server, there is also paluten and gronkh.
These are german youtubers. Wait! Wasn’t yesterday 
the twitch rivals minecraft? Did they play?
I don’t see them in the list. No clue what’s 
going on there. Maybe it’s a secret society
meeting of big gaming youtubers. It says here it’s 
version 1.16.5. So I install that and then try to
join. I’m NOW ALSO A BIG MINECRAFT YOUTUBER. 
But of course I’m not allowed to join. Aww…
Okay… so… the data is there now. what 
do we do with this information now?
Well… I don’ know to be honest. I don’t have 
any big goals. The PROJECT ITSELF was the goal.
I wanted to work on some technical projects 
related to minecraft. This way I can turn my
gaming addiction into something productive. And 
that’s what I did here. I wrote this scanner,
I scanned servers. I gained tons of more IT 
experience. And I’m happy. There was no goal.
JUST KIDDING! OF COURSE I DID ALL 
THIS TO GRIEF THE SERVERS? MUAHAHHA…
LET’S GO! I wrote simple python 
script that looks through all my data,
picks a random 1.18.2 servers, and wrote the IP 
to the etc hosts file. This way I can connect
to random_server.local, and get connect 
to a random server. So let’s go! Connect.
Oh looks like there is activity on 
this server. Let’s find some flint
and steel or TNT so we can get started!
With flyhack and xray it should be easy!
Oh hello there! We even have somebody 
who can watch us destroy THEIR WORLD!!!!
JUST KIDDING! Of course I’m not griefing. I want 
to look at amazing builds form other people. And
so I’m officially the ANTI-GRIEF SQUAD. If I 
join your server, I leave with a net positive.
So let’s maybe harvest and replant some of 
those crops. And then we did a bit of good.
Next server. This one looks a bit empty. Probably 
they just moved away from spawn. I flew around a
bit but couldn’t find any buildings. But I 
still wanted to leave with a net positive.
So I got some wood, crafted a chest. And placed 
the leftover materials in there. There we go. Next
server. Ah nice, some more player activity here. 
Over there, it looks like a castle. Interesting.
I love the new terrain generation. I really should 
have built in such a place as well. Anyway. this
looks like some automatic smelting setup?
But nothing there.
There was also a nether portal and maybe it’s 
a highway to a bigger base? There was a long
hallway. So let’s run down and see where it leads. 
BTW this is NOT speed up. This is just the flyhack
basically walking on the ground. This is the 
actual speed. OH MY GOD, almost ran into that lava
fall. Okay nothing here as well. Let’s go back. 
We did pickup a lot of blocks from our sprint,
so let’s place them into a chest, and 
then we also did something good on here.
Next server.
Another player is online here. Cool. We had a
nice chat and I wanted to find where they are, so 
maybe I could help them mining. With my xray mod
I could collect a few diamonds for them. I flew 
around spawn but just didn’t see them anywhere.
And then I had my glitch again. I got disconnected 
for flying. But I HAVEN’T DONE ANYTHING GOOD YET.
And the person i talked to was so nice. So 
I wanted to go back. But… I’m banned. Sorry.
Next server.
Ok this server looks crazy. There are also
commandblocks and buttons that teleport around. 
There are loots of builds on here. I also noticed
that there are entire diamond block buildings, 
so I guess I don’t need to help anybody here.
They got everything. But it’s still super fun 
flying around and exploring some of the builds.
And UH! What’s that over there?
THAT IS HOGWARTS. FOR SURE. I KNOW A HOGWARTS
WHEN I SEE IT. YEP. that’s definitely hogwarts.
By the way there is an incredible harry
potter hogwarts minecraft map and 
whole game. It’s incredible. Let’s
see what else we can find on here.
Uh… I really like this walkway here,
the reddish fences look really nice. 
Maybe I steal this for my own server.
On to the next server.
This spawn looked insane.
LOOK AT THIS. So pretty. A green oasis surrounded 
by big snowy mountains. A beautiful pathway.
I really need to take some inspiration from here.
And at the end of the path, there is even this
amazing house. Really cool. In one chest I found 
a pickaxe and I thought I wanted to help out
and find some diamonds. I flew over the mountain 
top and on the other side I found a village where
definitely players had built stuff. This here 
is an iron farm. I really like it when people
try to make their farms fit into the world. And 
this totally fits into this village. Really nice.
There was also a nether portal which led to a 
mob farm. And looks like they have also enough
materials already. I don’t think I can really 
help much here. So let me go all the way back,
and return the pickaxe. And onto the next server.
Here I finally used my xray. I got an iron
pickaxe, went underground and mined 
some diamonds. I really hope they
appreciate that. Put them in the chest. And 
the ANTI-GRIEF SQUAD is on to the next server.
This server was really fun again. There was a 
player online. They were not at spawn but I got
lucky and found their place while flying around. 
UH there they are. Hellooo.. Just looking around.
They still have iron armor, so maybe they 
would really appreciate a few dimaaonds.
I found some sticks but still need iron to 
craft a pickaxe. Is there no iron around?
But then this funny situation happened.
They asked, “How did you get here so
fast?”. And I, just casually, slowly float 
upwards. Like a real SUPER Saiyan BADASS?”.
And the reaction. “Oh”.
And just a moment later.
I got killed. And put into adventure mode.
Actually, that’s really nice. Thanks for
still allowing me to explore your server and not 
banning me right away. But I would have really
liked to mine some diamonds for you as well.
Anyway. Back to exploration. I looked at their
villager trading prison. Which is actually 
quite comfortable. They really have a lot
of space with a bed. In my villager 
trading hall. This wont be the case.
Anyway. That was fun exploring random 
minecraft servers. Minecraft itself is
a game about adventures and exploring the unknown 
world. And so this is really just an extension to
that. Joining these random worlds is very nice to 
see. You never know what you will stumble into.
So here is my video idea for you. 
Instead of griefins random servers,
why don’t you try to be more creative and try to 
figure out a way how you can help on the server.
Create a house to extend their village, do 
a bit of farming. Some mining. I don’t know.
There are tons of nicer things you can 
do. Anyway. Back to my own world again.
The iron farm and sugar cane farm is done. 
Here is the iron farm. The zombie is constantly
scaring the villagers, which will summon an 
iron golem. And everything around is spawn
proof. Except the kill room. So the golem can 
only spawn in here and is pushed into the laval.
Whichs kills the golem slowly. The dropped iron 
is then collected by some hoppers. And below
the farm I built some basic item sorting. BTW.
I named the zombie “upper management” because
it’s like a joke. It’s like a joke for adults. 
Doing nothing all day and focring the poor workers
to do their job and spawn the iron golem. Yeah.
Anyway.
Here is the sugar cane farm. The observers 
will see if the sugarcane grew tall enough.
And then trigger the pistons destroying part 
of the sugar cane. Which is then picked up
by the hopper minecart below. Also a very 
basic design you can find everywhere online.
BUT I tried to make it more pretty so it fits 
into the area. I used campfire to make these
chimneys. And I think now it kinda looks like 
an industrial building fitting into this space.
Cool.
Next up is the
villager trading hall.. I got started on it, 
but I will tell you more about it next video.
