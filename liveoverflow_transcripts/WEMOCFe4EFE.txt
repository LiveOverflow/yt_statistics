I know I f’ed up. I kept leaking the IP 
of the server and tons and tons of people
joined. And it really got out of hand. So I 
decided to change the IP address. However,
this did not stop them. They are still 
coming. And now I’m trying to hide from them.
Look what they did to my lovely spawn place. 
All my chests and loot are gone. My bed is
gone. And they keep mocking me with these 
signs. And over here in my base. My animals
are gone. my beautiful trees and decorations 
are gone. And they even STOLE my beehives.
On the other hand, THERE ARE TONS OF 
AWESOME BUILDS NOW. What the heck is
this? An ender pearl teleport service?
And over here. This is the BEST thing on
the server. This is so awesome! This is an item 
sorter and storage system. I always wanted to have
this and so I’m very happy this was built. 
I believe it was __SEBASTIAN__? Thank you!
Oh… I cannot find the items I put into. Okay I 
guess it looks like the Sorter is broken again….
et’s go investigate. How does it even work. 
So from the chest the items go into a dropper
and the items get passed along. Let’s try 
to follow this path and find where they
ended up. All of these chests and hoppers 
are empty. But this looks like a dropper
elevator. Using the redstone texture pack 
we can figure out their orientation. And
indeed. They point upwards. So the 
items are probably transported up.
Looking around a bit more I came across this 
cart. And in the chest above it, there are
the items. It looks like this cart is stuck, so 
maybe that is why the sorter is not working again.
Destroying the cart and placing it again, now 
it’s moving again and the sorter appears working.
It does stand on an activator rail so somehow it 
didn’t get a signal. So maybe we just have to make
sure it can be activated? And ohhh look at that. 
Sb already added a button to do exactly that. I
see. You know what, let’s extend this debug button 
to the front so the cart can be more easily reset.
I build a basic line of redstone with inverters 
that basically act as extensions and then outside
we place a button. And a sign to tell people they 
can press it if the sorter appears stuck again.
Awesome!
Also by the way, very nice stone floor design and
some nice plants here. I like this kind of design.
Anyway. Let’s explore a bit more. Flying up to
my old afk farm spot we can find tons of 
more signs. It’s so crazy. And look at the
INCREDIBLE liveoverflow logo in the sky. 
No clue who built it, but it’s amazing!
Remember, this server is all survival. Yes, 
people can hack and cheat on here, but still,
it’s still lots of effort that goes into 
this. And I really really appreciate that.
But now we come to the most crazy build of all.
Do you recognize this?
This is the spawn. This is the forest where 
I had built the bedrock hole with a spawn
protected perimeter. Some people had messed with 
it with lavacasts, but look how it looks now!
I DID NOT BUILD THIS! I DID 
NOT PUT A HOUSE AND LAKE THERE.
And the red concrete is actually a pixelated 
version of my glitched recording logo.
This is absolutely incredible. I watched them 
build this. At first they had to clean up the
spawn from any of the leftover lavacast. I was 
traveling at the time and only had my macbook
with me. So the recording is terrible. But they 
started by flinging TNT into the build protected
area with fishing rods, and then they started 
to build flying machines outside the perimeter
which then fly in, pickup the bad blocks 
and fly them out the other side. It’s crazy.
But they didn’t stop there. Some player 
used the flying and pushing machines to
build a jumping challenge course above 
it with the concrete colored blocks.
And then look at the footage of the house 
getting built. What a crazy dedication.
In this area the simplest most basic minecraft 
task of “placing a block” becomes a complete
engineering challenge. It’s amazing. Just 
look at the effort that went into this.
And the spawn was completed with 
a trans and a raindbow flag.
You know the internet is a toxic place. 
Anarchy servers and other social places
without any rules quickly fall into a complete 
nazi and racist shitshow. But look at this,
this server is a server project where I 
try to attract skilled people and there
are no anti-griefing plugins, no real rules. 
And yes of course we have some griefing BUT,
overall it’s a very positive community that 
formed on here and dominates this server. Of
course this might change at some point. And 
then maybe I will also take the server down.
But regardless of what happens in the future, up 
until this point, I will remember this server as
an example where when you gather a bunch of 
super smart people and skilled hackers, you
get an amazing place. It doesn’t immediately fall 
into absolute chaos. And I think that’s beautiful.
But you know what? Before everything turns 
sour on here. It’s probably time to finish
this game. Let’s go do the end and 
defeat the final boss of minecraft.
To get there we have to find a stronghold. 
And how do we find it? Well… this is a
server for hackers of course we just have 
to fly to the coordinates 1337,1337. What
did you expect? Trust me. That’s how it works.
So here we are. 1337, 1337. And of course others
have been here before me. So the stronghold has 
to be somewhere here. I’m using a freecam mod
because I’m too lazy to develop it myself and so 
there we have it. And OH MY GOD. I just realized
I forgot the eye of enders for the portal.
So I had to fly back. I checked the sorter
where luckily I found tons of ender pearls. 
But I still needed some blaze rods. Which
means we need to go to the nether. I went 
on the seed map from chunkbase, entered the
server seed and looked for a stronghold. 
This one seems close by. Lets go there.
While I travel there to find blazes for some 
rods. I briefly wanted to mention how I got
a seed with the stronghold near 1337,1337.
You know when I saw the chunkbase website I
was wondering how they get such a fast map 
and structure rendering. I know from the
seedcracking episodes how computationally 
expensive world generation can be. So
this really impressed me. how is that done?
I started to investigate and eventually stumbled
over cubiomes which is a c implementation of world 
generation which can be used to bruteforce seeds.
So for this series I wanted to find a seed 
where a large variety of biomes as well as
all possible structures are as close as possible 
to spawn, and I want a text seed that starts with
LiveOverflow. And additionally I want a stronghold 
near 1337,1337. So I let this code run for a few
days and eventually I selected a nice seed 
which ended up to be the seed of this world.
So now you know why the seed had these weird 
numbers. I was bruteforcing seeds for particular
patterns.
Anyway.
Small detour but we are back with the eye 
of enders and can finally light the portal.
So… are you ready?!
Welcome to my tutorial on how to
defeat the FINAL LEVEL OF MINECRAFT!
Lets head in.
As you can see I came prepared. Most importantly 
are the water buckets because LOOK AT HOW MANY
ENEMIES THERE ARE. But they are scared of 
water. So you can place two water sources on
the floor and start fighting all of them. 
There will be quite a few waves of these
monsters but you just have to keep fighting. 
Hopefully your bought enough food with you.
This is a very tough and long fight. 
Believe me it can take a while.
And eventually THERE! THERE IS THE FINAL 
BOSS. HEROBRINE. LET’S GO AND ATTACK. ATTACK!
Uhm… okay give me a second. Something is 
weird. Let me check the minecraft wiki.
“Once the player enters the End, the only way 
back is to die or defeat the ENDER DRAGON??
The dragon spawns naturally and flies around above 
ten towers of obsidian arranged in a circle around
the central Exit Portal. Destroying the crystal 
while the dragon is healing damages the dragon.”
THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A 
DRAGON? WHERE IS THE DRAGON???
I see… the dragon is missing because other 
players have completed the dragon fight before
me. WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE? Script kiddies 
with their wurst or meteor clients they just
downloaded somewhere. They can’t even write 
a single line of code for their own hacks.
These losers ruin my game. This has to end!
And you know what. Remember all the afk bots
standing around at spawn? They are awesome. 
They don’t do anything. They don’t ruin
anything. They just stand there. They can stay.
But all the human players. GET THEM OUT OF HERE.
Let’s write an anti-human plugin for the server.
The idea I have is that humans move in weird ways,
while bots and machines they always 
walk in nice straight lines. So how
about we restrict the movement to very cleanly 
rounded values. None of this human imprecision.
I don’t know how to develop a server plugin, 
so let’s figure out how that works. As always,
YouTube is a great place. I simply search 
for a example plugin development tutorial
but I’m mainly interested in how to get 
a development environment setup. And
essentially I ended up installing the intellij 
minecraft plugin and then when you create a new
project you can choose, for example to 
create a bukkit or paper server plugin.
From the basic example plugin tutorial I also 
learned that you can subscribe to events. And
looking through the API documentation about the 
available events I found the playerMoveEvent.
Using grep.app I can then search again 
for useful code snippets to learn how to
implement that event handler. In my case I look 
for examples implementing the PlayerMoveEvent.
Eventually I ended up with this code.
If the position of the player changed
I get the current location, get the X and Z 
coordinate, multiple the coordinate by 1000 and
cast it to a long. And then I use %10 to basically 
check the last digit. So is the last digit a 0.
If both coordinates are not a 0, we 
detected a human player and we kick them!
I hope that works.
Let’s see it in action.
So if we stand still, nothing 
happens, but as soon as we move,
we get kicked. Human player detected, and a code 
snippet to show what the failed check was. Nice.
You know, while we are at it. 
How do server plugins even work?
Let me quickly summarize what we 
generally learned about servers so far.
Minecraft has an official server, but 
as you know most people run a different
server implementation. I for example 
use paper. And we learned that paper,
as well as the other servers, are 
basically patching the source code
of minecraft. And to get the source code 
they decompile the official server .jar.
And you can guess it, plugin support 
is added by patching those servers.
So look again at our code when we are 
creating a listener. this listener
is registered with the server.
And somehow when a player moves,
our function, onPlayerMove, is called. 
Where it passes in a PlayerMoveEvent.
Let’s try to find where that happens. 
Here I have a paper server development
setup which we used before to figure 
out a bypass for the flying detection,
or how the creeper AI works. so let’s use this 
again and simply search for the PlayerMoveEvent.
And look here, here is a ServerGamePacketListener 
creating this event object. When we go there we
actually find a massive function, which 
is called “handleMovePlayer”. So this
is the minecraft function that is called 
when a player sends a movement packet to
the server. Here it does a lot of checks 
and you can also see sometimes comments
like these. //CraftBukkit or //Paper.
These are code modifications added by
for example bukkit or paper and to make 
that clear they also add such a comment.
And somewhere deep in that function 
we have this PlayerMoveEvent code.
So here a new PlayerMoveEvent object is created 
with a reference to the current player and the
from and to location, and then it calls into 
the current pluginManager and calls that event.
If we look up an implementation of the 
callEvent code, we can for example find
the simplePluginManager which simply loops 
over the list of all registered listeners,
Now it makes sense, right? in our plugin code 
we registered a listener, so it gets added to a
listener list. And then here it loops over this 
list, checks if the plugin of that listener is
currently enabled and then tries to call the 
event handler function of that plugin. And
that’s how our function gets called, and we get 
the player and the position in our plugin code.
Cool!
I hope this explanation for server plugins
helps you to better understand the limitations of 
plugins and also why plugins work the way they do.
I’m pretty happy with the plugin, it should really 
help clean up the server from script kiddies,
but I also need a bypass myself to continue 
playing. So I will have to write some code now.
But for a while, this is the end 
for script kiddies on the server.
And for those that seek a challenge. Try 
to find the spot where hackers gather.
