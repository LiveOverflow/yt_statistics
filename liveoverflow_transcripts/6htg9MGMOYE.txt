Oh my gosh, I can’t really believe it.
We have only one challenge left, in Pwn Adventure
3…
Overachiever.
Which means we have to get all the Achievements
available in the game, but throughout the
episodes we got most of them.
Only First Blood and Killing Spree is missing.
Both are related to PVP.
In the first episode, the casual let’s play
we already discovered a key that enables PvP.
Oh, enabling PvP in... okay so if you press
V you start PVP
But how can we win this, if I’m playing
alone?
Well… we do the easiest hack of all.
We make a second account.
There is “asd”, and we enable PvP and
then just kill him.
Shoot… and fail… eh… gread hitboxes.
Ehm… there we go.
First Blood.
Now we just have to repeat that 9 more times.
We can do it with a few different weapons
and magic spells that we have acquired throughout
the game.
Ahh… the memories…
Last one…
Boom.
Killing Spree.
Acquired Flag of the Overachiever.
Unable to get flag contents?
You do not own this flag?
Try again later?
WHAT THE HECK?
That is what you see when you tried to cheat
yourself a flag item on the client, but the
server hasn’t given you the actual flag.
What did we do?
Did the admins of the game detect that we
were abusing a second account?
Just kidding.
I don’t know why this happened.
So I reconnect.
LiveOverflow, 7 Flags.
AWESOME!
So that looks good.
Let’s drop into the game, inventory.
Flag of the Overachiever.
Amazing.
There is the key.
“Achievement Unlocked, Red Ring of Death”.
An XBox reference.
What a journey, I really enjoyed this series,
but it was also a ton of work.
I’m so happy that I completed it.
I hope you enjoyed it too…
One last, very important thing.
There is an amazing credits outro song for
Pwn Adventure 3, by Fuzyll, Azsyka, Don’t
Panic and Lightning.
It’s a parody on the Portals 2 credit song
and the lyrics are just great.
Please lean back and enjoy:
So awesome.
My favorite line was: “Tomcr00se just solved
it all.
And now leads the scoreboard.
It’s such a shame the same will never happen
to you”.
What a sick burn.
outch!
But… this is not quite the end of our journey.
There are a few things I’d like to play
around with, because things like LD_PRELOAD
do not exist on Windows and I really want
to checkout how it could be done there.
But I probably need help from some Windows
experts, because I have no clue.
So stay tuned for that.
