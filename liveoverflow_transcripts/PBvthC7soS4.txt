so today was the first day of the ctf
in the morning john and i arrived there
fairly early
to play one of the challenges
that challenge was special because
everything got a time slot one single
time slot
for that day and so we had to come in
[Music]
early
google why is everything so early
today's the day of the ctf
it's 7 30 and i need to be at 8
at google because they have prepared
like a challenge that john and me have
to do
like right in the beginning before the
ctf starts
uh you will see why in a moment but
i need to very quickly shower and then
head out so
see you there just in time let's go
good morning morning do you want to be
on camera
or not sure okay this is for the rico
hello
so do you think you should watch the
video first or the
picture uh let's go to the video first
it's six minutes oh my gosh
it's just this for six minutes there's
no context
i died all right
we have a couple of minutes left before
the ctf uh we also received this
envelope
every team gets such an envelope we
don't really know what's inside and we
wait with opening it up
to like nine o'clock when the other
teams also open it up
so um we will see what's in there it's
probably like
the wi-fi password and things like that
but maybe there's
more to it there's definitely there's
definitely something in it
what is it wearing nothing
so have fun good luck and
never else ever be in your favor
first one
[Music]
so the first actual challenge was just
solved by red rocket
unfortunately he was a remote player so
they have no clue how it was solved
but yeah congrats that was the big first
blood i guess
so the challenge that was just solved by
red rocket is called stuffed
it's in the misc category and the
challenge description
reads just click the link and the page
displays the flag
easy right but when you go onto
this website it shows a plain like flag
colon and then nothing happens and the
site keeps loading
and doesn't really do anything at some
point it like crashes the the tab
crashes but when you try to look at the
request for example with burp you get a
very
different response it says not
acceptable and the text reads that
to avoid a repeat of last month's
bandwidth bill we only support browsers
that can understand
broadly compression supported browsers
include chrome firefox edge safari and
opera
of course we are using chrome but we are
going through this proxy with this http
request
i wonder where the flag itself is hiding
maybe you somehow just has to have to
get to the
actual like data stream but there's the
ssl layer so maybe the
the the stuff that comes out of the ssl
layer at least was my thought that might
be the compressed data and then you
somehow have to decompress it
so i try to use openssl to connect to
this ssl server but
it didn't seem to work i get ssl errors
apparently like there's a handshake
failure so
now i'm not quite sure how to approach
this also i got to talk to two teams
that attempted the
b challenge when they were coming out
and both teams also
didn't succeed so i'm quite happy about
that because we failed
so this is
foreign
thank you
first one
okay folks so all challenges are now
released there will be no more
challenges
happy hacking and that's it
good luck
hey everyone so we have our first
attempt for the gomeon challenge
which is punable it's a browser
exploitation challenge
one team here by stephen king i think
they have an expert so let's try it out
all right all right let's try it okay
that's it go back to work
[Music]
okay so there's a serious lack of cola
to fulfill my addiction but now there
were some
so i stole two and i will put them in my
bag
for tomorrow morning because i need that
stuff in the morning
it's almost 8 pm which means that the
ctf is almost over i think
let's go into the ctf room and just have
a last overview of
how the ctf area looks like after the
first day
as you can see the ctf players are still
concentrated as always
by and yeah outside there are just some
of the staff
the organizers um still hanging out
but yeah it's not much going on anymore
except here again
here look it's gadget overflow my
favorite youtuber
so the ctf players just left the
scoreboard and challenges stay online
but they will not be supported so if the
challenges crash overnight or go down
um they will not get any support but
they still have the chance to solve them
overnight
so it will be kind of interesting in the
next morning when this
when the flag submission goes back
online again and they can then submit
all the flags
uh maybe we see a lot of crazy
animations tomorrow so i reviewed a
couple of the
recordings i've done i'm backing them up
always from the sd card so to have it in
two places
and i noticed that a lot of the footage
is blurry
because i accidentally switched to auto
to manual focus
or for example when i talked to guinwell
the autofocus was set to
looking for eyes and for whatever reason
it didn't really recognize our
faces a lot and it focused on the eyes
on the laptop
from greenville and when he closed it
that's when it started to focus back on
our faces
like things like this i kind of need to
learn
also for interviews i noticed that the
white aperture to get like the nice
blurry effect is not really good because
as soon as like
the people are at different distances
like leaning forward or backward they
start to get blurry too
that's not a good fit so yeah sorry for
the
not so great footage um but you know
i now i'm gaining experience how to do
it better and
in the end i still think it shows kind
of like the spirit and
ex and shares the experience with you at
around 8pm
the ctf was over for the day
and i yeah and basically all the ctf
players went back here to the hotel but
i'm sure
they will work throughout the night or
through most of the night so i will now
lay into bed with my laptop
try a bit more some of the challenges
there's one
that i kind of like wanna understand a
bit better so i
will look more into that i'm i'm not
even close
in anything solving so does that and
then i guess sleep soon
so yeah talk to you tomorrow
[Music]
foreign
