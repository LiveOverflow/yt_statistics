EVERYBODY.
GRAB YOUR BLACK HOODIES.
PUT YOUR GUY FAWKES MASK ON.
ALL HACKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE AGAINST THE
INCREDIBLE INJUSTICE BY … youtube…
I cannot stand the constant drama and complaints
by youtubers and their audiences.
I was hoping to never make such a video, but
well… here we are.
we just experience some drama in our infosec,
hacking, it security YouTube realms.
And people are feaking out.
So let me share my views as one of the biggeer
hacking channels on YouTube.
So YouTube updated their support page regarding
“Harmful or dangerous content”, which
basically explains what kind of videos are
not allowed on the plattform.
For example
Dangerous or threatening pranks, which means,
Pranks that lead victims to fear imminent
serious physical danger, or that create serious
emotional distress in minors.
or
Instructional theft: Showing users how to
steal money or tangible goods.
Stuff like that sounds reasonable
And now the big controversy.
Instructional hacking and phishing: Showing
users how to bypass secure computer systems
or steal user credentials and personal data.
This controversy was specifically triggered
and amplified by the YouTube channel Null-byte,
because they had three of their videos taken
down, and received a strike.
That means their ability to upload videos
was taken away.
Absolute nightmare for a YouTuber.
I totally understand their emotional reaction
to that.
They work incredibly hard on creating content,
and having it so easily taken away, is scary.
But I also think there is no need to panic.
And so please just chill, and let’s look
at this rationally.
Let’s look at some objective data and the
experience we had with YouTube so far.
First we need to clarify something.
A lot of the YouTube drama we generally see,
not in IT security, just generally, and that
is perpetrated by popular YouTubers, are often
shrouded in some cloud of confusion, and they
are not really clear about what exactly is
going on.
So the biggest “issue” (in quotation marks)
is about the algorithm and video recommendations.
And hand in hand with that, monetization.
I don’t really care about that, you should
not care either, and let me quickly explain
why.
YouTubers can earn money through adsense that
automatically places ads for them on their
videos.
They get a share.
That is super nice and chill.
In the early days of YouTube this didnt even
exist.
So it’s quite a luxury nowadays.
Many YouTubers now depend on this income.
Also Ad revenue is directly affected by your
view numbers.
So your income under normal circumstances
already varies 50% up and down every month
- which is crazy to think about.
Super stressful to see your income fluctuate
constantly.
Worst workplace ever.
And now on top of that you have sometimes
videos only getting limited or no ads (the
yellow icon) or completely demonetized.
Or copyright claimed...
Along with that also can come, that videos
are not recommended as much anymore.
I can tell you from my own statistics, that
most of the views are coming from recommendations.
From non-subscribers.
So any changes to the algorithm or monetization
policies, directly impact the YouTubers income,
thus directly impacts stress levels and emotions.
But, you are still free to run your own ads
in your videos.
I think we have just been pretty lazy and
spoiled with automatic ads via adsense.
But I also have empathy, I understand that
it’s scary when that falls away, but come
on - do some basic business risk analysis.
I feel for you.
But I disagree that you then mobilize your
audience as an army to complain to youtube
about that.
In general I think the ad system is great
because it’s lazy, rather than wasting time
talking to potential advertising partners,
it lets you focus on creating.
I find this empowering and great by YouTube.
But I think you have zero right to force or
demand advertisers to advertise on your video.
And just as a reminder, even if there were
much stronger monetization policies, that
block most videos from earning money, YouTube
still provide you more services than you get
on other plattforms like Facebook or Instagram.
On other platforms you don’t demand and
expect to get money.
And don’t forget, you are free to host our
videos anywhere else, like on vimeo or our
own websites.
This is not censorship.
Please stop conflating government enforced
censorship with a ad policy of a for-profit
company.
But ads is one thing.
We are also freaking out, because loosing
YouTube would mean loosing this amazing algorithm
recommending our videos to other people.
We would loose the free advertising for our
own videos.
Remember, this is a feature not a right.
On facebook you have to PAY that your videos
get shared and seen by more people.
YT gives you free advertisement for videos
they think are worth sharing.
That’s the youtube recommendation algorithm.
And if you have monetization, they even get
advertisements for you.
You don’t have to do shit.
I see that as a bonus, a feature, that only
YouTube gives us.
So for me this is a typical psychological
case where people don’t care for something
they don’t have, but freak out when a free
bonus is taken away.
Feeling entitled to that what was given for
free.
Okay got that out of the way.
Monetization, I don’t care.
Message to my fellow YouTubers, I don’t
mean you to stop complaining about algorithm
and your demonetized videos, I know it really
hurts, and talking about it is good too, but
I think it’s not fair to mobilize a mob
for it.
But let’s get to what I do care about.
I care about awesome educational channels
and videos that are take down from them.
let’s explore that scary policy update Instructional
hacking and phishing.
I would like to start by going back a few
months.
In october 2018 three hacking related channels
were terminated.
Stephen Chapman, Guided Hacking and Cheat
The Game.
All of these channels were creating technical
videos about reverse engineering and hacking
games.
And they got taken down because of the policy
regarding a “Circumvention of Technologies
complaint”.
Which violates YouTube's Terms of Service.
everybody was panicking.
Everybody was freaking out.
So what happened.
Well… all three channels are back.
You can subscribe to them right now.
Did they get it back because of a public outcry?
Of course I don’t work at Google, I don’t
know.
But I would say no.
That’s not how I see this to work.
What does work is “Contacting the YouTube
Creator Support team” or in the worst case
google employees directly.
They happen to be watching our videos too,
they sometimes are able to escalate or re-open
a cases internally.
So shortly after, the channels were back.
However I have heard of other hacking related
channels, for example the security podcast
ThugCrowd, their channel was deleted around
the similar time.
And didn’t get it back.
And apparently other channels too.
Unfortunately I don’t know exactly the kind
of videos that were on there.
I cannot speak for the type and STYLE how
it was presented.
So I cannot judge those cases.
But there is the example we see right now.
The three videos from Nul-byte were flagged
and they got a strike.
Well…
A couple of hours later, the videos are back
up and the strike removed.
And again, I don’t really think that a public
outcry and media attention was necessary.
I think what helped was appealing the strike
and again google employees that are in the
audience raising this issue internally.
And besides those cases I have only ever heard
of monetization issues.
But it’s very likely that I miss many cases
of other deleted videos.
It’s not like I know all the hacking videos
on YouTube.
So yes, we had some issues.
But don’t forget the context, you must look
at the cases that never triggered anything.
I have over 230 videos uploaded since 2015
about hacking.
Gynvael does hacking livestreams for a long
time now.
And when you look through my featured channels,
you can discover plenty of YouTubers doing
hacking and security videos.
Combined we have thousands of videos.
I don’t think they had any issues.
Besides maybe monetization, but as I said,
I don’t care about that.
And even null-byte has over 100 videos that
were apparently no problem.
But of course, It’s about a new policy,
right?
It’s a policy change that NOW triggers the
deletion and flagging of all our videos.
Well hold on a minute.
as far as I know these policies are in effect
already for a long time.
Hak5, probably the oldest running hacking
YouTube channel with over 1500 videos also
seems to agree:
Likewise dealt with any issues on a case by
case basis.
The sky isn’t falling and these policies
have been in effect for as long as we’ve
been publishing on YouTube.
The instructional hacking policy has been
in effect for years.
Let’s approach this policy thing with a
bit more brain.
Hacking is a term that can mean maaaany things.
I don’t want to discuss meanings and interpretations
now.
But you know that hacking can be criminal.
Every country has slightly different laws
on what is legal and what is illegal.
I’m not saying these laws are done with
much insight.
For YouTube to follow exactly those laws and
interpret them correctly, is impossible for
an international company, so they have to
come up with their own sensible policies,
based on some idea of ethics.
Ideally we want these policies to follow a
good ethics argument.
An argument we can follow and undersatnd.
The frustration with policies comes when they
diverge from your own ethics.
When you believe something is ethical, and
somebody else says it’s not, then that causes
friction.
This is where I think the frustration lays.
So now we open up this huge bucket of what
it means to do hacking videos ethically.
And I could ramble about that for hours.
I see this to be a VERY fine and blurry line.
Very small nuances that make me flip between
ethical and unethical.
Let me give you some examples how I see this,
and what I’m thinking when I make videos.
I see game hacking and cheating as unethical...
when done for competitive multiplayer games.
Not when doing it alone at home.
When you write your own hacks I think that’s
cool.
Have some fun.
But in the context of sharing it with hundreds,
thousand maybe tens of thousands of people
via a YouTube video, I think that can be bad.
So I have a sense of responsibility based
on the audience sice and possible reach.
I think a talk given at a security meetup
or a hackerspace is different from a video
seen by thousands of possibly impressionable
young teenagers.
And of course it is even worse when you advertise,
sell or distribute those hacks to be used.
In the best case it just ruins the game experience
for some players, in the worst case cheaters
cause a decline in the player base and thus
losses for the game developer.
However generally developing a cheat, or a
trainer or mods for a normal single-player
game.
That’s awesome.
That’s creative and fun and harmless.
And so if you want to make game hacking videos
for the masses, focus on those kind of games.
Now if you put this into a policy, and you
need non-technical underpaid support staff
to be able make decisions, it’s really hard
to see if a game hacking channel like guided
hacking or stephen chapman do it ethically,
or not.
To be able to notice that difference does
require quite some experience.
So I totally understand that mistakes happen
and those channels got nuked.
BUT!
It then is important, and it worked out, that
once the context is explained and you were
able to appeal, that everything is reinstantiated.
It definitely sucks, but I think in a world
with humans that make mistakes, something
like this seems reasonable and forgivable
to me.
Another example is phishing.
There is no goddam reason for me to make a
video tutorial on how to make a facebook,
google or instagram phishing page.
I think eudcation is totally misdirected there.
If you would care about education you would
just make a web development tutorial.
Or if aimed at normal users, you would make
a video on how to detect a phishing page.
But you don’t need a step by step guide
to make a phishing site for facebook.
I think that’s somewhat unethical and maybe
can be considered inciting illegal behavior?
Especially considering this.
According to the paper “Data Breaches, Phishing,
or Malware?
Understanding the Risks of Stolen Credentials”,
millions of accounts get compromised because
of phishing.
Phishing is a real problem that Google fights
with every day, so being google, why would
want a tutorial outright showing how to do
that on your own platform.
I know it might sound silly, but most serious
hacks you hear about are phishing.
The political DNC hacks?
Phishing.
Phishing is lame, but it’s criminally serious.
And I think as a participant in a human society,
you should think about the context and effects
of your tutorials.
So I think a video on how to make a facebook
phishing page is unnecessary, and eduactionally
misdirected.
It’s just web development..
I believe the correct way to teach this topic
is just to show basics of PHP… ah wait…
teaching PHP might be unethical too…
I think YouTUbe should ban that.
I think that would have positive impact for
the future… just kidding.
There is of course a way to make ethical PHP
tutorials too…
You get my point.
Any web developer can make a phishing page
in the first week of learning web development.
And just to make this clear.
I don’t see deleting a phishing tutorial
as censoring important technical information.
And keeping it secrent Because a basic web
development tutorial teaches the SAME SKILL.
This knowledge is not hidden.
You just put it into an illegal or unethical
context.
Instead of showing step by step tutorial to
do phishing, just tell people to learn programming,
this is how they actually acquire skill and
knowledge.
That’s at least the motivation for many
of my videos.
If a person comes to my videos to learn “cool
hacking” I try to be the person that carefully
redirects them to where to actually get the
knowledge, and that is for example programming,
reading specifications, looking at research
papers, and so forth.
I don’t see any value in a Kali linux step
by step command instruction tutorial.
I also somewhat covered this in my “how
to learn hacking” video.
Very similar to that I see the topic of WiFi
hacking.
Maybe you didn’t know, but one reason for
starting my channel was because I was annoyed
as hell about all the Kali Wifi Hacking videos.
I think they are soooo damn boring and they
are not really what I think is educational.
And I think it’s clear that people like
to watch and make these videos, because you
can actually apply and do this in real life.
Hacking neighbors wifi for example.
But in many countries, this could be already
illegal.
I personally find step by step guides for
that stuff unnecessary to spread to masses
over YouTube.
I made one video about WiFi hacking and that
was about KRACK.
Not how to use a specific tool, but we look
at the paper and try to understand the underlaying
issue.
Do you see the difference here?
Just showing step by step how to use a tool,
versus looking at the underlaying research.
I think latter is the educational thing to
do, that’s why I do it.
The former is just a cheap cash grab for attention
with something that is much closer to the
border of legality and can be interpreted
as inciting illegal behaviour.
That’s generally my principle that I use
for my channel.
I think the educational content is explaining
the underlaying concept, not the step by step
copy&paste tutorial on how to use aircrack.
Maybe you disagree with me saying that a wifi
hacking tutorial is shit, but if youtube is
actually thinking the same way, that still
means you don’t need to worry that my videos
are being taken down.
Because I don’t make videos like that.
Another similar example would be trojan or
malware.
If you truly care about how that stuff works
you would checkout some malware reverse engineering
or you learn programming, or some code golfing
and file format tricks.
Because trojans are nothing else than just
programs.
With maybe some creative obfuscation and file
tricks.
So if you show people how to make trojans,
maybe even worse, just use a tool that generates
a RAT, then I don’t see the value.
I mean you can show such things exist, but
you don’t need a step by step guide on how
to use it, and you can hide the name, because
nobody should care about where to get that
tool.
It’s not useful knowledge to me.
For example there is a big trend of remote
admin tools, for mobile phones, that are primarily
used in abusive relationships to control the
partner.
Also called stalkerware.
If you show somebody how to install or get
such a thing, and youtubers have even advertised
such products before.
You suck.
Unnecessary.
Unethical.
In many cases illegal and criminal and causing
direct harm to people.
And no, a disclaimer at the start “for educational
purposes only”, is bullshit.
If I would want to make a video about it,
I would show how to detect stalkerware, the
capabilities so you understand how to deal
with it, or how to reverse engineer and analyse
them.
That would be a good video I think.
Those are just some nuanced cases.
it would be great to organize and gather more
data on that.
If we look closely at the videos and channels
that get taken down by YouTube, I’m sure
we can reason about what was risky, and we
can also talk about, how could you have made
the video move further away from possibly
motivating illegal behaviour, more towards
actual education.
So I believe, when YouTube writes a policy
like this, they are thinking about it in a
similar way.
Instructional hacking and phishing: Showing
users how to bypass secure computer systems
or steal user credentials and personal data.
I think Google is not dumb and I would hope
they see it somehwat similar like me, which
means my videos shouldn’t cause issues.
I mean there are humans sitting in offices
on a whiteboard trying to come up with sensible
rules.
I think they try to decide what is unethical
and what is a ethical hacking video.
And I also feel like the data we have shows
that that’s the case.
because all our ethical channels never had
issues.
Or if an issue appeared we were able to resolve
it quickly.
To me that’s proof that the system works.
Anyway.
YouTube constantly works on their policies.
Hacking is just one SMALL area of concern
for them.
And hacking is such a difficult topic for
an outsider to judge.
To be honest I’m mostly surprised we don’t
have more issues.
If you are realistic how much the average
person knows about it, it’s almost a miracle
that we run so smooth.
I actually expect something much worse must
happen at some point.
Some bigger mistake should happen.
Somebody will always misunderstand or misjudge
our hacking videos.
But I know that we have Google employees in
our audience that care about us, and they
have raised internally some concern in the
past.
And have been part of internal discussions
around those policies.
I believe the reason why I and many others
had no real issues, is because of proactive
policy discussions internally.
If that was you, thanks!
And while I kinda hate this drama stirring
up on twitter about it, it did get the attention
of even more Google employees.
So for example laparisa got notice of it - she
is a pretty important figure in security at
google.
So if she adds an opinion to some kind of
internal discussion about this hacking policy,
I’m sure it carries weight.
So long story short.
I don’t think you need to panic.
Next time a YouTuber complaints about something,
express your empathy to them, it sucks, but
then maybe just give it one or two days before
jumping on the drama bandwagon to see if things
get resolved.
I think if a couple of our hundreds or thousands
of videos here and there have issues.
Or some channel as a whole has some problems,
I think that’s forgivable as long as we
can resolve it.
What we need is that the escalation process
at YouTube works and we are able to talk to
humans.
BUT, that’s my view in July 2019, based
on the evidence I have seen so far.
Things could always change.
So if we would see actual widespread strikes
and account terminations, then we can always
get our black hoodies and guy fawkes masks
out to stir up some drama.
Let’s not paint the devil on the wall.
Let’s wait until the system actually fails
us.
When the attempts of contacting support and
appealing fails.
Then I will be more than happy to march with
you
That being said.
It would be kinda awkward if I make this video,
then my channel is taken down, and I would
look like fool.
Please don’t do this to me YouTube!
But if it happens.
*Clap* *clap*.
That will be funny as hell.
I can see the “didn’t age well” memes
already.
I will make sure to retweet it too.
And as a last tip.
If you are a YouTuber, or just interested
in the YouTube behind-the scenes world, checkout
the official Creator Insider YouTube channel.
This is where you always get informed about
policyx clarifications, experiments and changes
coming to YouTube.
They also interview engineers and go over
policy examples.
Maybe you can ask them to make a video about
clarifying the hacking policy.
I would love to see barbara sit down with
some engineers, maybe even have somebody from
Security at Google join them.
If they go over a few examples regarding this
policy, that would be awesome for us to better
understand this.
By the way, I have asked a few people to give
their opinion on various fictional hacking
YouTube videos.
If they deem it ethical, unethical or neutral.
It’s by no means a good scientific survey.
But I just wanted to get a sense about it
and see how it aligns or clashes with my views
and opinion.
I have made a casual talking video about the
results.
You can find it in the corner, description
or directly on LiveOverflow2.
Now after running around in your black hoodie
all day, put it into the wash, and store it
in the closet for the next drama.
