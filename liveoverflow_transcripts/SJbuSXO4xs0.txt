did you ever have RSI or any pain
working typing so much never never a
problem never had something like this I
wonder if it's actually has to do with
my pen spinning stuff because obviously
every time when I have a pen I always
have a pen like laying here I always do
this kind of stuff I wonder if that's
like helps me with my fingers I don't
know
