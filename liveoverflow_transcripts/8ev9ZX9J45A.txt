Security CTFs, or Capture-The-Flag competitions
have nothing to do with paintball or shooter
games, but they are awesome to learn hacking.
They can be very challenging and teach you
a lot of new skills.
In this video I want to tell you about what
kind of challenges there are and how you can
find CTFs to play.
Generally there are two categories of CTFs.
Jeopardy-style and Attack-and-defense.
While the second one sounds like a lot of
fun, personally I have never played one.
So I will only focus on the Jeopardy-style,
especially because it’s easier to get into.
So a typical CTF offers a bunch of different
challenges that you have to solve.
Most commonly you have to exploit some kind
of service so you get remote access to the
server, so you can then read the content of
a file that contains a special string, the
flag, which is proof that you hacked the system.
You can then enter that string in a form and
you get points depending on how hard the challenge
was for your team.
Usually a challenge has a title, a short description
and maybe infos on how to reach the service
or a file to download.
Oftentimes the title or description is already
a small hint.
So for example there was a challenge called
sha1lcode at the HITCOn CTF 2014, and without
really looking into the challenge I already
assumed that you have to write shellcode,
and it has something to do with sha1 hashes.
Maybe writing shellcode in the form of sha1
hashes.
And indeed, that was the solution in the end.
There are a lot of different kinds of challenges,
and sometime you get some new creative ones,
but the typical topics covered are reversing,
pwning, crypto, web and maybe misc or programming.
Reversing usually comes with a executable,
a program you can download and run locally.
The program implements some kind of algorithm
that checks an input key.
If you find the correct key, which is oftentimes
already the correct flag, then you solved
it.
So solving it requires you to reverse engineer
and understand the implemented algorithm to
deduct the correct input key.
A good example for that is my Zwiebel video
write-up.
For pwning challenges you often get also an
executable, but with it an IP address and
port of a server running this program.
So you have to figure out how to exploit the
program to gain remote code execution.
You develop your exploit locally and then
use it against the server, where you can then
read the flag file.
These challenges range from simple buffer
overflows to very advanced heap feng shui
stuff.
And they are the most interesting ones to
me.
The cookbook challenge vide writeup on my
channel is one example of such a challenge.
Crypto, like the name says is about cryptography.
Sometimes it’s about attacking a self-made
cipher, or very simple crypto attacks like
weak random generators.
But it can get really advanced and mathematical.
Where you are basically lost if you are not
up to date with the research and papers form
that field.
I have a simple crypto video writeup from
the Internetwache CTF that gives you an idea,
but there are way more advanced ones where
I just yield.
You should check out hellman’s writeups.
Web challenges are also clear, they are about
web applications.
Usually you get a URL and you have to exploit
maybe a advanced SQL injection, or bypass
authentication.
Sometimes even XSS or CSRF challenges.
I also have a web challenge writeup where
you can get a feeling for what it is about.
Misc basically covers anything else.
And programming is also self explanatory.
Mostly it’s about clever implementations
of solving some kind of problem.
Now that you are excited about solving some
of these challenges, let’s talk about where
you can find them.
The best platform for all of this is ctftime.
It’s made by the CTF community for the CTF
community.
You can see which CTFs are upcoming and you
get information like the format, when it happens
and where to register.
You can also see the archive of competitions
in the past.
So for example the HITCON CTF recently.
And below, you see the final ranking of all
teams.
Each CTF has points attached to it.
Hard CTFs have high numbers like 50, or 75
points.
Easy CTFs have maybe only 5 or 10 points you
can get for them.
So if you participate in a very hard CTF and
do well, you are rewarded more than for easy
college CTFs where you can easily get rank
1.
But those CTFs are also really damn hard.
At least I struggle a lot with them.
Over the year the CTF teams collect these
points and you have an overall ranking.
Being in the top 50 is quite challenging.
But how to find a team?
Well it’s like finding a group of friends.
There is no one way how to do it.
I found my group from another security competition
I participated in.
And we kept hanging around on IRC and started
playing other CTFs.
And suddenly we had a serious team.
Before that I played CTFs solo, which meant
I would maybe solve only one challenge per
CTF but that’s fine, I can’t compete with
the crazy skilled people anyway, and I just
play for my own curiosity.
But you could also checkout the reddit CTF
team OpenToAll, which is, like the name says,
open to everybody.
But all these CTFs are usually short.
They are over a weekend.
Maybe 48-72 hours.
But there are also websites where these kind
of challenges are available forever.
So I played a lot on w3challs, smashthestack
and overthewire.
In the beginning you will realize you know
nothing.
You fail every challenge you try.
But that’s normal.
So what I always do, I will look up the challenge
after the event.
Because people create writeups or upload their
exploit script.
And then you can work through those solutions.
You can research topics you didn’t know
about.
You see how other people solve it.
And you start to gain experience.
And you will see that after a couple of CTFs
you start to be able to make progress yourself.
So for that prupose you should look up the
writeups on ctftime, or the ctf writeup github
repository (maybe contribute yourself by gathering
other peoples writeups and create a pull request),
or simply hang around on the IRC channel of
the competition, because people will start
discussing solutions afterwards.
I hope this quick overview was helpful to
get into challenges yourself.
And maybe consider recording yourself solving
them during the CTF.
Just make sure you don’t beg for flags,
solutions and hints.
Respect the competition.
Be excellent to each other.
And accept your lack of skill and convert
it into motivation to learn more.
